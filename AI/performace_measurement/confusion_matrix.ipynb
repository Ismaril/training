    "A confusion matrix is a table used in classification to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. It provides a summary of the predicted and actual classifications done by a classification algorithm. The matrix is particularly useful for understanding the types and the frequency of errors made by the model. The confusion matrix consists of four main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- True Positive (TP): Instances that were correctly predicted as positive. In a binary classification problem, this represents the number of observations that were actually positive and were correctly identified as positive by the model.\n",
    "- True Negative (TN): Instances that were correctly predicted as negative. In a binary classification problem, this represents the number of observations that were actually negative and were correctly identified as negative by the model.\n",
    "- False Positive (FP): Instances that were incorrectly predicted as positive. In a binary classification problem, this represents the number of observations that were actually negative but were incorrectly identified as positive by the model (Type I error).\n",
    "- False Negative (FN): Instances that were incorrectly predicted as negative. In a binary classification problem, this represents the number of observations that were actually positive but were incorrectly identified as negative by the model (Type II error).\n"

As a result, the classifier will only get a high F1 score if both recall and precision are high. It makes sense to use F1 if precision and recall have similar values."

    "Imagine we trained a classifier to detect videos that are safe for kids. You would prefer a classifier that rejects many good videos (low recall) but keeps only safe ones (high precision) rather than a classifier that has a much higher recall but lets a few really bad videos show up in your product.\n",
    "On the other hand, letâ€™s say you train a classifier to detect shoplifters on surveillance images. It is probably fine if your classifier has only 30% precision as long as it has 99% recall (sure, the security guards will get a few false alerts, but almost all shoplifters will get caught).\n",
