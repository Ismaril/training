    "# Chapter 18. Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "Reinforcement learning (RL) is one of the most exciting fields of machine learning today, and also one of the oldest. It has been around since the 1950s, producing many interesting applications over the years, particularly in games (e.g., TD-Gammon, a Backgammon-playing program) and in machine control, but seldom making the headline news. However, a revolution took place in 2013, when researchers from a British startup called DeepMind demonstrated a system that could learn to play just about any Atari game from scratch, eventually outperforming humans in most of them, using only raw pixels as inputs and without any prior knowledge of the rules of the games. This was the first of a series of amazing feats, culminating with the victory of their system AlphaGo against Lee Sedol, a legendary professional player of the game of Go, in March 2016 and against Ke Jie, the world champion, in May 2017. No program had ever come close to beating a master of this game, let alone the world champion. Today the whole field of RL is boiling with new ideas, with a wide range of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how did DeepMind (bought by Google for over $500 million in 2014) achieve all this? With hindsight it seems rather simple: they applied the power of deep learning to the field of reinforcement learning, and it worked beyond their wildest dreams. In this chapter I will first explain what reinforcement learning is and what it’s good at, then present two of the most important techniques in deep reinforcement learning: policy gradients and deep Q-networks, including a discussion of Markov decision processes. Let’s get started!"

    "# Learning to Optimize Rewards\n",
    "In reinforcement learning, a software agent makes observations and takes actions within an environment, and in return it receives rewards from the environment. Its objective is to learn to act in a way that will maximize its expected rewards over time. If you don’t mind a bit of anthropomorphism, you can think of positive rewards as pleasure, and negative rewards as pain (the term “reward” is a bit misleading in this case). In short, the agent acts in the environment and learns by trial and error to maximize its pleasure and minimize its pain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is quite a broad setting, which can apply to a wide variety of tasks. Here are a few examples (see Figure 18-1):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The agent can be the program controlling a robot. In this case, the environment is the real world, the agent observes the environment through a set of sensors such as cameras and touch sensors, and its actions consist of sending signals to activate motors. It may be programmed to get positive rewards whenever it approaches the target destination, and negative rewards whenever it wastes time or goes in the wrong direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The agent can be the program controlling Ms. Pac-Man. In this case, the environment is a simulation of the Atari game, the actions are the nine possible joystick positions (upper left, down, center, and so on), the observations are screenshots, and the rewards are just the game points.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Similarly, the agent can be the program playing a board game such as Go. It only gets a reward if it wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The agent does not have to control a physically (or virtually) moving thing. For example, it can be a smart thermostat, getting positive rewards whenever it is close to the target temperature and saves energy, and negative rewards when humans need to tweak the temperature, so the agent must learn to anticipate human needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The agent can observe stock market prices and decide how much to buy or sell every second. Rewards are obviously the monetary gains and losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there may not be any positive rewards at all; for example, the agent may move around in a maze, getting a negative reward at every time step, so it had better find the exit as quickly as possible! There are many other examples of tasks to which reinforcement learning is well suited, such as self-driving cars, recommender systems, placing ads on a web page, or controlling where an image classification system should focus its attention."

    "The policy can be any algorithm you can think of, and it does not have to be deterministic. In fact, in some cases it does not even have to observe the environment! For example, consider a robotic vacuum cleaner whose reward is the amount of dust it picks up in 30 minutes. Its policy could be to move forward with some probability p every second, or randomly rotate left or right with probability $1 – p$. The rotation angle would be a random angle between $–r$ and $+r$. Since this policy involves some randomness, it is called a stochastic policy. The robot will have an erratic trajectory, which guarantees that it will eventually get to any place it can reach and pick up all the dust. The question is, how much dust will it pick up in 30 minutes?\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you train such a robot? There are just two policy parameters you can tweak: the probability $p$ and the angle range $r$. One possible learning algorithm could be to try out many different values for these parameters, and pick the combination that performs best (see Figure 18-3). This is an example of policy search, in this case using a brute-force approach. When the policy space is too large (which is generally the case), finding a good set of parameters this way is like searching for a needle in a gigantic haystack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to explore the policy space is to use genetic algorithms. For example, you could randomly create a first generation of 100 policies and try them out, then “kill” the 80 worst policies and make the 20 survivors produce 4 offspring each. An offspring is a copy of its parent plus some random variation. The surviving policies plus their offspring together constitute the second generation. You can continue to iterate through generations this way until you find a good policy."

We will discuss this approach, called policy gradients (PG), in more detail later in this chapter. Going back to the vacuum cleaner robot, you could slightly increase $p$ and evaluate whether doing so increases the amount of dust picked up by the robot in 30 minutes; if it does, then increase $p$ some more, or else reduce $p$. We will implement a popular PG algorithm using TensorFlow, but before we do, we need to create an environment for the agent to live in—so it’s time to introduce OpenAI Gym."

    "# Introduction to OpenAI Gym\n",
    "One of the challenges of reinforcement learning is that in order to train an agent, you first need to have a working environment. If you want to program an agent that will learn to play an Atari game, you will need an Atari game simulator. If you want to program a walking robot, then the environment is the real world, and you can directly train your robot in that environment. However, this has its limits: if the robot falls off a cliff, you can’t just click Undo. You can’t speed up time either—adding more computing power won’t make the robot move any faster—and it’s generally too expensive to train 1,000 robots in parallel. In short, training is hard and slow in the real world, so you generally need a simulated environment at least for bootstrap training. For example, you might use a library like PyBullet or MuJoCo for 3D physics simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI Gym is a toolkit that provides a wide variety of simulated environments (Atari games, board games, 2D and 3D physical simulations, and so on), that you can use to train agents, compare them, or develop new RL algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI Gym is preinstalled on Colab, but it’s an older version, so you’ll need to replace it with the latest one. You also need to install a few of its dependencies.

    "You may wonder why we are picking a random action based on the probabilities given by the neural network, rather than just picking the action with the highest score. This approach lets the agent find the right balance between exploring new actions and exploiting the actions that are known to work well. Here’s an analogy: suppose you go to a restaurant for the first time, and all the dishes look equally appealing, so you randomly pick one. If it turns out to be good, you can increase the probability that you’ll order it next time, but you shouldn’t increase that probability up to 100%, or else you will never try out the other dishes, some of which may be even better than the one you tried. This exploration/exploitation dilemma is central in reinforcement learning.\n",

    "Also note that in this particular environment, the past actions and observations can safely be ignored, since each observation contains the environment’s full state. If there were some hidden state, then you might need to consider past actions and observations as well. For example, if the environment only revealed the position of the cart but not its velocity, you would have to consider not only the current observation but also the previous observation in order to estimate the current velocity. Another example is when the observations are noisy; in that case, you generally want to use the past few observations to estimate the most likely current state. The CartPole problem is thus as simple as can be; the observations are noise-free, and they contain the environment’s full state.\n",

The number of inputs is the size of the observation space—which in the case of CartPole is 4—and we have just five hidden units because it’s a fairly simple task.

    "# Evaluating Actions: The Credit Assignment Problem\n",
    "If we knew what the best action was at each step, we could train the neural network as usual, by minimizing the cross entropy between the estimated probability distribution and the target probability distribution. It would just be regular supervised learning. However, in reinforcement learning the only guidance the agent gets is through rewards, and rewards are typically sparse and delayed. For example, if the agent manages to balance the pole for 100 steps, how can it know which of the 100 actions it took were good, and which of them were bad? All it knows is that the pole fell after the last action, but surely this last action is not entirely responsible. This is called the credit assignment problem: when the agent gets a reward, it is hard for it to know which actions should get credited (or blamed) for it. Think of a dog that gets rewarded hours after it behaved well; will it understand what it is being rewarded for?\n",
    "\n",
    "To tackle this problem, a common strategy is to evaluate an action based on the sum of all the rewards that come after it, usually applying a discount factor, $\\gamma$ (gamma), at each step. This sum of discounted rewards is called the action’s return. Consider the example in Figure 18-6. If an agent decides to go right three times in a row and gets a +10 reward after the first step, 0 after the second step, and finally –50 after the third step, then assuming we use a discount factor $\\gamma = 0.8$, the first action will have a return of $10 + \\gamma \\times 0 + \\gamma^2 \\times (-50) = -22$. If the discount factor is close to 0, then future rewards won’t count for much compared to immediate rewards. Conversely, if the discount factor is close to 1, then rewards far into the future will count almost as much as immediate rewards. Typical discount factors vary from 0.9 to 0.99. With a discount factor of 0.95, rewards 13 steps into the future count roughly for half as much as immediate rewards (since $0.95^{13} \\approx 0.5$), while with a discount factor of 0.99, rewards 69 steps into the future count for half as much as immediate rewards. In the CartPole environment, actions have fairly short-term effects, so choosing a discount factor of 0.95 seems reasonable.\n"

    "Of course, a good action may be followed by several bad actions that cause the pole to fall quickly, resulting in the good action getting a low return. Similarly, a good actor may sometimes star in a terrible movie. However, if we play the game enough times, on average good actions will get a higher return than bad ones. We want to estimate how much better or worse an action is, compared to the other possible actions, on average. This is called the action advantage. For this, we must run many episodes and normalize all the action returns, by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. After that, we can reasonably assume that actions with a negative advantage were bad while actions with a positive advantage were good. OK, now that we have a way to evaluate each action, we are ready to train our first agent using policy gradients. Let’s see how."

However, if the action’s advantage is negative, it means the action was probably bad, and you want to apply the opposite gradients to make this action slightly less likely in the future. The solution is to multiply each gradient vector by the corresponding action’s advantage.\n",

It may alternate a number of times between these two states, but eventually it will fall into state $s_3$ and remain there forever, since there’s no way out: this is called a terminal state.

    "\n",
    "The main problem with Q-learning is that it does not scale well to large (or even medium) MDPs with many states and actions. For example, suppose you wanted to use Q-learning to train an agent to play Ms. Pac-Man (see Figure 18-1). There are about 150 pellets that Ms. Pac-Man can eat, each of which can be present or absent (i.e., already eaten). So, the number of possible states is greater than $2^{150} \\approx 10^{45}$. And if you add all the possible combinations of positions for all the ghosts and Ms. Pac-Man, the number of possible states becomes larger than the number of atoms in our planet, so there’s absolutely no way you can keep track of an estimate for every single Q-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to find a function $ Q_\\theta(s, a) $ that approximates the Q-value of any state-action pair $(s, a)$ using a manageable number of parameters (given by the parameter vector $ \\theta $). This is called approximate Q-learning. For years it was recommended to use linear combinations of handcrafted features extracted from the state (e.g., the distances of the closest ghosts, their directions, and so on) to estimate Q-values, but in 2013, DeepMind showed that using deep neural networks can work much better, especially for complex problems, and it does not require any feature engineering. A DNN used to estimate Q-values is called a deep Q-network (DQN), and using a DQN for approximate Q-learning is called deep Q-learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, how can we train a DQN? Well, consider the approximate Q-value computed by the DQN for a given state-action pair $(s, a)$. Thanks to Bellman, we know we want this approximate Q-value to be as close as possible to the reward $ r $ that we actually observe after playing action $ a $ in state $ s $, plus the discounted value of playing optimally from then on. To estimate this sum of future discounted rewards, we can just execute the DQN on the next state $ s' $, for all possible actions $ a' $. We get an approximate future Q-value for each possible action. We then pick the highest (since we assume we will be playing optimally) and discount it, and this gives us an estimate of the sum of future discounted rewards. By summing the reward $ r $ and the future discounted value estimate, we get a target Q-value $ y(s, a) $ for the state-action pair $(s, a)$, as shown in Equation 18-7.\n"

So, we need to mask out all the Q-values we do not need. The tf.one_hot() function makes it possible to convert an array of action indices into such a mask. For example, if the first three experiences contain actions 1, 1, 0, respectively, then the mask will start with [[0, 1], [0, 1], [1, 0],...]. We can then multiply the DQN’s output with this mask, and this will zero out all the Q-values we do not want. We then sum over axis 1 to get rid of all the zeros, keeping only the Q-values of the experienced state-action pairs. This gives us the Q_values tensor, containing one predicted Q-value for each experience in the batch.\n",

    "As you can see, the algorithm took a while to start learning anything, in part because $\\epsilon$ was very high at the beginning. Then its progress was erratic: it first reached the max reward around episode 220, but it immediately dropped, then bounced up and down a few times, and soon after it looked like it had finally stabilized near the max reward, at around episode 320, its score again dropped down dramatically. This is called catastrophic forgetting, and it is one of the big problems facing virtually all RL algorithms: as the agent explores the environment, it updates its policy, but what it learns in one part of the environment may break what it learned earlier in other parts of the environment. The experiences are quite correlated, and the learning environment keeps changing—this is not ideal for gradient descent! If you increase the size of the replay buffer, the algorithm will be less subject to this problem. Tuning the learning rate may also help. But the truth is, reinforcement learning is hard: training is often unstable, and you may need to try many hyperparameter values and random seeds before you find a combination that works well. For example, if you try changing the activation function from \"elu\" to \"relu\", the performance will be much lower."

As the researcher Andrej Karpathy put it, “[Supervised learning] wants to work. […​] RL must be forced to work”. You will need time, patience, perseverance, and perhaps a bit of luck too. This is a major reason RL is not as widely adopted as regular deep learning (e.g., convolutional nets). But there are a few real-world applications, beyond AlphaGo and Atari games: for example, Google uses RL to optimize its datacenter costs, and it is used in some robotics applications, for hyperparameter tuning, and in recommender systems."

Conversely, the loss could go up, yet the agent might perform better (e.g., if the DQN was underestimating the Q-values and it starts correctly increasing its predictions, the agent will likely perform better, getting more rewards, but the loss might increase because the DQN also sets the targets, which will be larger too).

    "In a 2015 paper, DeepMind researchers tweaked their DQN algorithm, increasing its performance and somewhat stabilizing training. They called this variant double DQN. The update was based on the observation that the target network is prone to overestimating Q-values. Indeed, suppose all actions are equally good: the Q-values estimated by the target model should be identical, but since they are approximations, some may be slightly greater than others, by pure chance. The target model will always select the largest Q-value, which will be slightly greater than the mean Q-value, most likely overestimating the true Q-value (a bit like counting the height of the tallest random wave when measuring the depth of a pool). To fix this, the researchers proposed using the online model instead of the target model when selecting the best actions for the next states, and using the target model only to estimate the Q-values for these best actions.

    "\n",
    "Instead of sampling experiences uniformly from the replay buffer, why not sample important experiences more frequently? This idea is called importance sampling (IS) or prioritized experience replay (PER), and it was introduced in a 2015 paper by DeepMind researchers (once again!).\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, experiences are considered “important” if they are likely to lead to fast learning progress. But how can we estimate this? One reasonable approach is to measure the magnitude of the TD error $\\delta = r + \\gamma \\cdot V(s') - V(s)$. A large TD error indicates that a transition $(s, a, s')$ is very surprising, and thus probably worth learning from. When an experience is recorded in the replay buffer, its priority is set to a very large value, to ensure that it gets sampled at least once. However, once it is sampled (and every time it is sampled), the TD error $\\delta$ is computed, and this experience’s priority is set to $p = |\\delta|$ (plus a small constant to ensure that every experience has a nonzero probability of being sampled). The probability $P$ of sampling an experience with priority $p$ is proportional to $p^\\zeta$, where $\\zeta$ is a hyperparameter that controls how greedy we want importance sampling to be: when $\\zeta = 0$, we just get uniform sampling, and when $\\zeta = 1$, we get full-blown importance sampling. In the paper, the authors used $\\zeta = 0.6$, but the optimal value will depend on the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s one catch, though: since the samples will be biased toward important experiences, we must compensate for this bias during training by downweighting the experiences according to their importance, or else the model will just overfit the important experiences. To be clear, we want important experiences to be sampled more often, but this also means we must give them a lower weight during training. To do this, we define each experience’s training weight as $w = (n \\cdot P)^{-\\beta}$, where $n$ is the number of experiences in the replay buffer, and $\\beta$ is a hyperparameter that controls how much we want to compensate for the importance sampling bias (0 means not at all, while 1 means entirely). In the paper, the authors used $\\beta = 0.4$ at the beginning of training and linearly increased it to $\\beta = 1$ by the end of training. Again, the optimal value will depend on the task, but if you increase one, you will usually want to increase the other as well.\n",

    "The dueling DQN algorithm (DDQN, not to be confused with double DQN, although both techniques can easily be combined) was introduced in yet another 2015 paper by DeepMind researchers. To understand how it works, we must first note that the Q-value of a state-action pair $(s, a)$ can be expressed as $ Q(s, a) = V(s) + A(s, a) $, where $ V(s) $ is the value of state $ s $ and $ A(s, a) $ is the advantage of taking the action $ a $ in state $ s $, compared to all other possible actions in that state. Moreover, the value of a state is equal to the Q-value of the best action $ a^* $ for that state (since we assume the optimal policy will pick the best action), so $ V(s) = Q(s, a^*) $, which implies that $ A(s, a^*) = 0 $. In a dueling DQN, the model estimates both the value of the state and the advantage of each possible action. Since the best action should have an advantage of 0, the model subtracts the maximum predicted advantage from all predicted advantages. Here is a simple DDQN model, implemented using the functional API:\n"

    "# Overview of Some Popular RL Algorithms\n",
    "Before we close this chapter, let’s take a brief look at a few other popular algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "**AlphaGo**\n",
    "AlphaGo uses a variant of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) based on deep neural networks to beat human champions at the game of Go. MCTS was invented in 1949 by Nicholas Metropolis and Stanislaw Ulam. It selects the best move after running many simulations, repeatedly exploring the search tree starting from the current position, and spending more time on the most promising branches. When it reaches a node that it hasn’t visited before, it plays randomly until the game ends, and updates its estimates for each visited node (excluding the random moves), increasing or decreasing each estimate depending on the final outcome. AlphaGo is based on the same principle, but it uses a policy network to select moves, rather than playing randomly. This policy net is trained using policy gradients. The original algorithm involved three more neural networks, and was more complicated, but it was simplified in the AlphaGo Zero paper, which uses a single neural network to both select moves and evaluate game states. The AlphaZero paper generalized this algorithm, making it capable of tackling not only the game of Go, but also chess and shogi (Japanese chess). Lastly, the MuZero paper continued to improve upon this algorithm, outperforming the previous iterations even though the agent starts out without even knowing the rules of the game!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actor-critic algorithms**\n",
    "Actor-critics are a family of RL algorithms that combine policy gradients with deep Q-networks. An actor-critic agent contains two neural networks: a policy net and a DQN. The DQN is trained normally, by learning from the agent’s experiences. The policy net learns differently (and much faster) than in regular PG: instead of estimating the value of each action by going through multiple episodes, then summing the future discounted rewards for each action, and finally normalizing them, the agent (actor) relies on the action values estimated by the DQN (critic). It’s a bit like an athlete (the agent) learning with the help of a coach (the DQN).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C)**\n",
    "This is an important actor-critic variant introduced by DeepMind researchers in 2016 where multiple agents learn in parallel, exploring different copies of the environment. At regular intervals, but asynchronously (hence the name), each agent pushes some weight updates to a master network, then it pulls the latest weights from that network. Each agent thus contributes to improving the master network and benefits from what the other agents have learned. Moreover, instead of estimating the Q-values, the DQN estimates the advantage of each action (hence the second A in the name), which stabilizes training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantage actor-critic (A2C)**\n",
    "A2C is a variant of the A3C algorithm that removes the asynchronicity. All model updates are synchronous, so gradient updates are performed over larger batches, which allows the model to better utilize the power of the GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Soft actor-critic (SAC)**\n",
    "SAC is an actor-critic variant proposed in 2018 by Tuomas Haarnoja and other UC Berkeley researchers. It learns not only rewards, but also to maximize the entropy of its actions. In other words, it tries to be as unpredictable as possible while still getting as many rewards as possible. This encourages the agent to explore the environment, which speeds up training, and makes it less likely to repeatedly execute the same action when the DQN produces imperfect estimates. This algorithm has demonstrated an amazing sample efficiency (contrary to all the previous algorithms, which learn very slowly).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proximal policy optimization (PPO)**\n",
    "This algorithm by John Schulman and other OpenAI researchers is based on A2C, but it clips the loss function to avoid excessively large weight updates (which often lead to training instabilities). PPO is a simplification of the previous trust region policy optimization (TRPO) algorithm, also by OpenAI. OpenAI made the news in April 2019 with its AI called OpenAI Five, based on the PPO algorithm, which defeated the world champions at the multiplayer game Dota 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Curiosity-based exploration**\n",
    "A recurring problem in RL is the sparsity of the rewards, which makes learning very slow and inefficient. Deepak Pathak and other UC Berkeley researchers have proposed an exciting way to tackle this issue: why not ignore the rewards, and just make the agent extremely curious to explore the environment? The rewards thus become intrinsic to the agent, rather than coming from the environment. Similarly, stimulating curiosity in a child is more likely to give good results than purely rewarding the child for getting good grades. How does this work? The agent continuously tries to predict the outcome of its actions, and it seeks situations where the outcome does not match its predictions. In other words, it wants to be surprised. If the outcome is predictable (boring), it goes elsewhere. However, if the outcome is unpredictable but the agent notices that it has no control over it, it also gets bored after a while. With only curiosity, the authors succeeded in training an agent at many video games: even though the agent gets no penalty for losing, the game starts over, which is boring so it learns to avoid it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Open-ended learning (OEL)**\n",
    "The objective of OEL is to train agents capable of endlessly learning new and interesting tasks, typically generated procedurally. We’re not there yet, but there has been some amazing progress over the last few years. For example, a 2019 paper by a team of researchers from Uber AI introduced the POET algorithm, which generates multiple simulated 2D environments with bumps and holes and trains one agent per environment: the agent’s goal is to walk as fast as possible while avoiding the obstacles. The algorithm starts out with simple environments, but they gradually get harder over time: this is called curriculum learning. Moreover, although each agent is only trained within one environment, it must regularly compete against other agents, across all environments. In each environment, the winner is copied over and it replaces the agent that was there before. This way, knowledge is regularly transferred across environments, and the most adaptable agents are selected. In the end, the agents are much better walkers than agents trained on a single task, and they can tackle much harder environments. Of course, this principle can be applied to other environments and tasks as well. If you’re interested in OEL, make sure to check out the Enhanced POET paper, as well as DeepMind’s 2021 paper on this topic."
