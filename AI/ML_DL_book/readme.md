This folder is all about studying and practising AI.
Lot of the code is from the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow" by
Aurélien Géron. Source to his repo: https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2 "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron.

TODO: The markdown cells for some reason no longer support backslashes '/', therefore they need to be
replaced with forward slashes '\'. (For your info if the images are not loading)
