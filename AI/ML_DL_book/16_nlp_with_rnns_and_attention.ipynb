    "# Chapter 16. Natural Language Processing with RNNs and Attention\n",
    "When Alan Turing imagined his famous Turing test in 1950, he proposed a way to evaluate a machine’s ability to match human intelligence. He could have tested for many things, such as the ability to recognize cats in pictures, play chess, compose music, or escape a maze, but, interestingly, he chose a linguistic task. More specifically, he devised a chatbot capable of fooling its interlocutor into thinking it was human. This test does have its weaknesses: a set of hardcoded rules can fool unsuspecting or naive humans (e.g., the machine could give vague predefined answers in response to some keywords, it could pretend that it is joking or drunk to get a pass on its weirdest answers, or it could escape difficult questions by answering them with its own questions), and many aspects of human intelligence are utterly ignored (e.g., the ability to interpret nonverbal communication such as facial expressions, or to learn a manual task). But the test does highlight the fact that mastering language is arguably Homo sapiens’s greatest cognitive ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we build a machine that can master written and spoken language? This is the ultimate goal of NLP research, but it’s a bit too broad, so in practice researchers focus on more specific tasks, such as text classification, translation, summarization, question answering, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common approach for natural language tasks is to use recurrent neural networks. We will therefore continue to explore RNNs (introduced in Chapter 15), starting with a character RNN, or char-RNN, trained to predict the next character in a sentence. This will allow us to generate some original text. We will first use a stateless RNN (which learns on random portions of text at each iteration, without any information on the rest of the text), then we will build a stateful RNN (which preserves the hidden state between training iterations and continues reading where it left off, allowing it to learn longer patterns). Next, we will build an RNN to perform sentiment analysis (e.g., reading movie reviews and extracting the rater’s feeling about the movie), this time treating sentences as sequences of words, rather than characters. Then we will show how RNNs can be used to build an encoder–decoder architecture capable of performing neural machine translation (NMT), translating English to Spanish.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part of this chapter, we will explore attention mechanisms. As their name suggests, these are neural network components that learn to select the part of the inputs that the rest of the model should focus on at each time step. First, we will boost the performance of an RNN-based encoder–decoder architecture using attention. Next, we will drop RNNs altogether and use a very successful attention-only architecture, called the transformer, to build a translation model. We will then discuss some of the most important advances in NLP in the last few years, including incredibly powerful language models such as GPT and BERT, both based on transformers. Lastly, I will show you how to get started with the excellent Transformers library by Hugging Face.\n",

    "# Generating Shakespearean Text Using a Character RNN\n",
    "In a famous 2015 blog post titled “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks”, Andrej Karpathy showed how to train an RNN to predict the next character in a sentence. This char-RNN can then be used to generate novel text, one character at a time. Here is a small sample of the text generated by a char-RNN model after it was trained on all of Shakespeare’s works:\n",

    "\n",
    "Not exactly a masterpiece, but it is still impressive that the model was able to learn words, grammar, proper punctuation, and more, just by learning to predict the next character in a sentence. This is our first example of a language model; similar (but much more powerful) language models, discussed later in this chapter, are at the core of modern NLP. In the remainder of this section we’ll build a char-RNN step by step, starting with the creation of the dataset."

Alternatively, you could try using beam search, which we will discuss later in this chapter, or using more GRU layers and more neurons per layer, training for longer, and adding some regularization if needed. Also note that the model is currently incapable of learning patterns longer than length, which is just 100 characters. You could try making this window larger, but it will also make training harder, and even LSTM and GRU cells cannot handle very long sequences. An alternative approach is to use a stateful RNN."

    "# Stateful RNN\n",
    "Until now, we have only used stateless RNNs: at each training iteration the model starts with a hidden state full of zeros, then it updates this state at each time step, and after the last time step, it throws it away as it is not needed anymore. What if we instructed the RNN to preserve this final state after processing a training batch and use it as the initial state for the next training batch? This way the model could learn long-term patterns despite only backpropagating through short sequences. This is called a stateful RNN. Let’s go over how to build one.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, note that a stateful RNN only makes sense if each input sequence in a batch starts exactly where the corresponding sequence in the previous batch left off. So the first thing we need to do to build a stateful RNN is to use sequential and nonoverlapping input sequences (rather than the shuffled and overlapping sequences we used to train stateless RNNs). When creating the tf.data.Dataset, we must therefore use shift=length (instead of shift=1) when calling the window() method. Moreover, we must not call the shuffle() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, batching is much harder when preparing a dataset for a stateful RNN than it is for a stateless RNN. Indeed, if we were to call `batch(32)`, then 32 consecutive windows would be put in the same batch, and the following batch would not continue each of these windows where it left off. The first batch would contain windows 1 to 32 and the second batch would contain windows 33 to 64, so if you consider, say, the first window of each batch (i.e., windows 1 and 33), you can see that they are not consecutive. The simplest solution to this problem is to just use a batch size of 1. The following to_dataset_for_stateful_rnn() custom utility function uses this strategy to prepare a dataset for a stateful RNN:"

    "Interestingly, although a char-RNN model is just trained to predict the next character, this seemingly simple task actually requires it to learn some higher-level tasks as well. For example, to find the next character after “Great movie, I really”, it’s helpful to understand that the sentence is positive, so what follows is more likely to be the letter “l” (for “loved”) rather than “h” (for “hated”). In fact, a 2017 paper⁠4 by Alec Radford and other OpenAI researchers describes how the authors trained a big char-RNN-like model on a large dataset, and found that one of the neurons acted as an excellent sentiment analysis classifier: although the model was trained without any labels, the sentiment neuron—as they called it—reached state-of-the-art performance on sentiment analysis benchmarks. This foreshadowed and motivated unsupervised pretraining in NLP.\n",

    "Generating text can be fun and instructive, but in real-life projects, one of the most common applications of NLP is text classification—especially sentiment analysis. If image classification on the MNIST dataset is the “Hello world!” of computer vision, then sentiment analysis on the IMDb reviews dataset is the “Hello world!” of natural language processing. The IMDb dataset consists of 50,000 movie reviews in English (25,000 for training, 25,000 for testing) extracted from the famous Internet Movie Database, along with a simple binary target for each review indicating whether it is negative (0) or positive (1).

    "Some reviews are easy to classify. For example, the first review includes the words “terrible movie” in the very first sentence. But in many cases things are not that simple. For example, the third review starts off positively, even though it’s ultimately a negative review (label 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a model for this task, we need to preprocess the text, but this time we will chop it into words instead of characters. For this, we can use the tf.keras.layers.TextVectorization layer again. Note that it uses spaces to identify word boundaries, which will not work well in some languages. For example, Chinese writing does not use spaces between words, Vietnamese uses spaces even within words, and German often attaches multiple words together, without spaces. Even in English, spaces are not always the best way to tokenize text: think of “San Francisco” or “#ILoveDeepLearning”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there are solutions to address these issues. In a 2016 paper, Rico Sennrich et al. from the University of Edinburgh explored several methods to tokenize and detokenize text at the subword level. This way, even if your model encounters a rare word it has never seen before, it can still reasonably guess what it means. For example, even if the model never saw the word “smartest” during training, if it learned the word “smart” and it also learned that the suffix “est” means “the most”, it can infer the meaning of “smartest”. One of the techniques the authors evaluated is byte pair encoding (BPE). BPE works by splitting the whole training set into individual characters (including spaces), then repeatedly merging the most frequent adjacent pairs until the vocabulary reaches the desired size.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2018 paper by Taku Kudo at Google further improved subword tokenization, often removing the need for language-specific preprocessing prior to tokenization. Moreover, the paper proposed a novel regularization technique called subword regularization, which improves accuracy and robustness by introducing some randomness in tokenization during training: for example, “New England” may be tokenized as “New” + “England”, or “New” + “Eng” + “land”, or simply “New England” (just one token). Google’s SentencePiece project provides an open source implementation, which is described in a paper by Taku Kudo and John Richardson.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TensorFlow Text library also implements various tokenization strategies, including WordPiece (a variant of BPE), and last but not least, the Tokenizers library by Hugging Face implements a wide range of extremely fast tokenizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for the IMDb task in English, using spaces for token boundaries should be good enough. So let’s go ahead with creating a TextVectorization layer and adapting it to the training set. We will limit the vocabulary to 1,000 tokens, including the most frequent 998 words plus a padding token and a token for unknown words, since it’s unlikely that very rare words will be important for this task, and limiting the vocabulary size will reduce the number of parameters the model needs to learn:"

    "The first layer is the TextVectorization layer we just prepared, followed by an Embedding layer that will convert word IDs into embeddings. The embedding matrix needs to have one row per token in the vocabulary (vocab_size) and one column per embedding dimension (this example uses 128 dimensions, but this is a hyperparameter you could tune). Next we use a GRU layer and a Dense layer with a single neuron and the sigmoid activation function, since this is a binary classification task: the model’s output will be the estimated probability that the review expresses a positive sentiment regarding the movie. We then compile the model, and we fit it on the dataset we prepared earlier for a couple of epochs (or you can train for longer to get better results).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sadly, if you run this code, you will generally find that the model fails to learn anything at all: the accuracy remains close to 50%, no better than random chance. Why is that? The reviews have different lengths, so when the TextVectorization layer converts them to sequences of token IDs, it pads the shorter sequences using the padding token (with ID 0) to make them as long as the longest sequence in the batch. As a result, most sequences end with many padding tokens—often dozens or even hundreds of them. Even though we’re using a GRU layer, which is much better than a SimpleRNN layer, its short-term memory is still not great, so when it goes through many padding tokens, it ends up forgetting what the review was about! One solution is to feed the model with batches of equal-length sentences (which also speeds up training). Another solution is to make the RNN ignore the padding tokens. This can be done using masking."

If you retrain the previous model for a few epochs, you will find that the validation accuracy quickly reaches over 80%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way this works is that the Embedding layer creates a mask tensor equal to tf.math.not_equal(inputs, 0): it is a Boolean tensor with the same shape as the inputs, and it is equal to False anywhere the token IDs are 0, or True otherwise. This mask tensor is then automatically propagated by the model to the next layer. If that layer’s call() method has a mask argument, then it automatically receives the mask. This allows the layer to ignore the appropriate time steps. Each layer may handle the mask differently, but in general they simply ignore masked time steps (i.e., time steps for which the mask is False). For example, when a recurrent layer encounters a masked time step, it simply copies the output from the previous time step.\n",

    "Next, if the layer’s supports_masking attribute is True, then the mask is automatically propagated to the next layer.

So if you have a model with several recurrent layers with return_sequences=True, followed by a recurrent layer with return_sequences=False, then the mask will automatically propagate up to the last recurrent layer: that layer will use the mask to ignore masked steps, but it will not propagate the mask any further. Similarly, if you set mask_zero=True when creating the Embedding layer in the sentiment analysis model we just built, then the GRU layer will receive and use the mask automatically, but it will not propagate it any further, since return_sequences is not set to True."

Some words are not as positive as you might expect (at least with this model), such as the word “good”, presumably because many negative reviews contain the phrase “not good”."

    "# Reusing Pretrained Embeddings and Language Models\n",
    "It’s impressive that the model is able to learn useful word embeddings based on just 25,000 movie reviews. Imagine how good the embeddings would be if we had billions of reviews to train on! Unfortunately, we don’t, but perhaps we can reuse word embeddings trained on some other (very) large text corpus (e.g., Amazon reviews, available on TensorFlow Datasets), even if it is not composed of movie reviews? After all, the word “amazing” generally has the same meaning whether you use it to talk about movies or anything else. Moreover, perhaps embeddings would be useful for sentiment analysis even if they were trained on another task: since words like “awesome” and “amazing” have a similar meaning, they will likely cluster in the embedding space even for tasks such as predicting the next word in a sentence. If all positive words and all negative words form clusters, then this will be helpful for sentiment analysis. So, instead of training word embeddings, we could just download and use pretrained embeddings, such as Google’s Word2vec embeddings, Stanford’s GloVe embeddings, or Facebook’s FastText embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using pretrained word embeddings was popular for several years, but this approach has its limits. In particular, a word has a single representation, no matter the context. For example, the word “right” is encoded the same way in “left and right” and “right and wrong”, even though it means two very different things. To address this limitation, a 2018 paper by Matthew Peters introduced Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo): these are contextualized word embeddings learned from the internal states of a deep bidirectional language model. Instead of just using pretrained embeddings in your model, you reuse part of a pretrained language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "At roughly the same time, the Universal Language Model Fine-Tuning (ULMFiT) paper by Jeremy Howard and Sebastian Ruder demonstrated the effectiveness of unsupervised pretraining for NLP tasks: the authors trained an LSTM language model on a huge text corpus using self-supervised learning (i.e., generating the labels automatically from the data), then they fine-tuned it on various tasks. Their model outperformed the state of the art on six text classification tasks by a large margin (reducing the error rate by 18–24% in most cases). Moreover, the authors showed a pretrained model fine-tuned on just 100 labeled examples could achieve the same performance as one trained from scratch on 10,000 examples. Before the ULMFiT paper, using pretrained models was only the norm in computer vision; in the context of NLP, pretraining was limited to word embeddings. This paper marked the beginning of a new era in NLP: today, reusing pretrained language models is the norm.\n",

    "# An Encoder–Decoder Network for Neural Machine Translation\n",
    "Let’s begin with a simple NMT model that will translate English sentences to Spanish (see Figure 16-3).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the architecture is as follows: English sentences are fed as inputs to the encoder, and the decoder outputs the Spanish translations. Note that the Spanish translations are also used as inputs to the decoder during training, but shifted back by one step. In other words, during training the decoder is given as input the word that it should have output at the previous step, regardless of what it actually output. This is called teacher forcing—a technique that significantly speeds up training and improves the model’s performance. For the very first word, the decoder is given the start-of-sequence (SOS) token, and the decoder is expected to end the sentence with an end-of-sequence (EOS) token.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each word is initially represented by its ID (e.g., 854 for the word “soccer”). Next, an Embedding layer returns the word embedding. These word embeddings are then fed to the encoder and the decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step, the decoder outputs a score for each word in the output vocabulary (i.e., Spanish), then the softmax activation function turns these scores into probabilities. For example, at the first step the word “Me” may have a probability of 7%, “Yo” may have a probability of 1%, and so on. The word with the highest probability is output. This is very much like a regular classification task, and indeed you can train the model using the \"sparse_categorical_crossentropy\" loss, much like we did in the char-RNN model."

    "OPTIMIZING THE OUTPUT LAYER\n",
    "When the output vocabulary is large, outputting a probability for each and every possible word can be quite slow. If the target vocabulary contained, say, 50,000 Spanish words instead of 1,000, then the decoder would output 50,000-dimensional vectors, and computing the softmax function over such a large vector would be very computationally intensive. To avoid this, one solution is to look only at the logits output by the model for the correct word and for a random sample of incorrect words, then compute an approximation of the loss based only on these logits. This sampled softmax technique was introduced in 2015 by Sébastien Jean et al. In TensorFlow you can use the tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss() function for this during training and use the normal softmax function at inference time (sampled softmax cannot be used at inference time because it requires knowing the target).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing you can do to speed up training—which is compatible with sampled softmax—is to tie the weights of the output layer to the transpose of the decoder’s embedding matrix (you will see how to tie weights in Chapter 17). This significantly reduces the number of model parameters, which speeds up training and may sometimes improve the model’s accuracy as well, especially if you don’t have a lot of training data. The embedding matrix is equivalent to one-hot encoding followed by a linear layer with no bias term and no activation function that maps the one-hot vectors to the embedding space. The output layer does the reverse. So, if the model can find an embedding matrix whose transpose is close to its inverse (such a matrix is called an orthogonal matrix), then there’s no need to learn a separate set of weights for the output layer."

This type of RNN makes sense when forecasting time series, or in the decoder of a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model.

    "# Beam Search\n",
    "Suppose you have trained an encoder–decoder model, and you use it to translate the sentence “I like soccer” to Spanish. You are hoping that it will output the proper translation “me gusta el fútbol”, but unfortunately it outputs “me gustan los jugadores”, which means “I like the players”. Looking at the training set, you notice many sentences such as “I like cars”, which translates to “me gustan los autos”, so it wasn’t absurd for the model to output “me gustan los” after seeing “I like”. Unfortunately, in this case it was a mistake since “soccer” is singular. The model could not go back and fix it, so it tried to complete the sentence as best it could, in this case using the word “jugadores”. How can we give the model a chance to go back and fix mistakes it made earlier? One of the most common solutions is beam search: it keeps track of a short list of the k most promising sentences (say, the top three), and at each decoder step it tries to extend them by one word, keeping only the $k$ most likely sentences. The parameter $k$ is called the beam width.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you use the model to translate the sentence “I like soccer” using beam search with a beam width of 3 (see Figure 16-6). At the first decoder step, the model will output an estimated probability for each possible first word in the translated sentence. Suppose the top three words are “me” (75% estimated probability), “a” (3%), and “como” (1%). That’s our short list so far. Next, we use the model to find the next word for each sentence. For the first sentence (“me”), perhaps the model outputs a probability of 36% for the word “gustan”, 32% for the word “gusta”, 16% for the word “encanta”, and so on. Note that these are actually conditional probabilities, given that the sentence starts with “me”. For the second sentence (“a”), the model might output a conditional probability of 50% for the word “mi”, and so on. Assuming the vocabulary has 1,000 words, we will end up with 1,000 probabilities per sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we compute the probabilities of each of the 3,000 two-word sentences we considered (3 × 1,000). We do this by multiplying the estimated conditional probability of each word by the estimated probability of the sentence it completes. For example, the estimated probability of the sentence “me” was 75%, while the estimated conditional probability of the word “gustan” (given that the first word is “me”) was 36%, so the estimated probability of the sentence “me gustan” is 75% × 36% = 27%. After computing the probabilities of all 3,000 two-word sentences, we keep only the top 3. In this example they all start with the word “me”: “me gustan” (27%), “me gusta” (24%), and “me encanta” (12%). Right now, the sentence “me gustan” is winning, but “me gusta” has not been eliminated."

    "\n",
    "This was the core idea in a landmark 2014 paper by Dzmitry Bahdanau et al., where the authors introduced a technique that allowed the decoder to focus on the appropriate words (as encoded by the encoder) at each time step. For example, at the time step where the decoder needs to output the word “fútbol”, it will focus its attention on the word “soccer”. This means that the path from an input word to its translation is now much shorter, so the short-term memory limitations of RNNs have much less impact. Attention mechanisms revolutionized neural machine translation (and deep learning in general), allowing a significant improvement in the state of the art, especially for long sentences (e.g., over 30 words)."

    "Figure 16-7 shows our encoder–decoder model with an added attention mechanism. On the left, you have the encoder and the decoder. Instead of just sending the encoder’s final hidden state to the decoder, as well as the previous target word at each step (which is still done, although it is not shown in the figure), we now send all of the encoder’s outputs to the decoder as well. Since the decoder cannot deal with all these encoder outputs at once, they need to be aggregated: at each time step, the decoder’s memory cell computes a weighted sum of all the encoder outputs. This determines which words it will focus on at this step. The weight $\\alpha_{t,i}$ is the weight of the $i^{th}$ encoder output at the $t^{th}$ decoder time step. For example, if the weight $\\alpha_{3,2}$ is much larger than the weights $\\alpha_{3,0}$ and $\\alpha_{3,1}$, then the decoder will pay much more attention to the encoder’s output for word #2 (“soccer”) than to the other two outputs, at least at this time step. The rest of the decoder works just like earlier: at each time step the memory cell receives the inputs we just discussed, plus the hidden state from the previous time step, and finally (although it is not represented in the diagram) it receives the target word from the previous time step (or at inference time, the output from the previous time step).\n"

    "But where do these $\\alpha_{t,i}$ weights come from? Well, they are generated by a small neural network called an alignment model (or an attention layer), which is trained jointly with the rest of the encoder–decoder model. This alignment model is illustrated on the righthand side of Figure 16-7. It starts with a `Dense` layer composed of a single neuron that processes each of the encoder’s outputs, along with the decoder’s previous hidden state (e.g., $h_{(2)}$). This layer outputs a score (or energy) for each encoder output (e.g., $e_{3,2}$): this score measures how well each output is aligned with the decoder’s previous hidden state. For example, in Figure 16-7, the model has already output “me gusta el” (meaning “I like”), so it’s now expecting a noun: the word “soccer” is the one that best aligns with the current state, so it gets a high score. Finally, all the scores go through a softmax layer to get a final weight for each encoder output (e.g., $\\alpha_{3,2}$). All the weights for a given decoder time step add up to 1. This particular attention mechanism is called Bahdanau attention (named after the 2014 paper’s first author). Since it concatenates the encoder output with the decoder’s previous hidden state, it is sometimes called concatenative attention (or additive attention).\n"

    "Another common attention mechanism, known as Luong attention or multiplicative attention, was proposed shortly after, in 2015, by Minh-Thang Luong et al. Because the goal of the alignment model is to measure the similarity between one of the encoder’s outputs and the decoder’s previous hidden state, the authors proposed to simply compute the dot product (see Chapter 4) of these two vectors, as this is often a fairly good similarity measure, and modern hardware can compute it very efficiently. For this to be possible, both vectors must have the same dimensionality. The dot product gives a score, and all the scores (at a given decoder time step) go through a softmax layer to give the final weights, just like in Bahdanau attention. Another simplification Luong et al. proposed was to use the decoder’s hidden state at the current time step rather than at the previous time step (i.e., $h_{(t)}$ rather than $h_{(t-1)}$), then to use the output of the attention mechanism (noted $\\widetilde{h}_{(t)}$) directly to compute the decoder’s predictions, rather than using it to compute the decoder’s current hidden state. The researchers also proposed a variant of the dot product mechanism where the encoder outputs first go through a fully connected layer (without a bias term) before the dot products are computed. This is called the “general” dot product approach. The researchers compared both dot product approaches with the concatenative attention mechanism (adding a rescaling parameter vector $\\mathbf{v}$), and they observed that the dot product variants performed better than concatenative attention. For this reason, concatenative attention is much less used now. The equations for these three attention mechanisms are summarized in Equation 16-1.\n"

    "In short, the attention layer provides a way to focus the attention of the model on part of the inputs. But there’s another way to think of this layer: it acts as a differentiable memory retrieval mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let’s suppose the encoder analyzed the input sentence “I like soccer”, and it managed to understand that the word “I” is the subject and the word “like” is the verb, so it encoded this information in its outputs for these words. Now suppose the decoder has already translated the subject, and it thinks that it should translate the verb next. For this, it needs to fetch the verb from the input sentence. This is analogous to a dictionary lookup: it’s as if the encoder had created a dictionary {\"subject”: “They”, “verb”: “played”, …​} and the decoder wanted to look up the value that corresponds to the key “verb”.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the model does not have discrete tokens to represent the keys (like “subject” or “verb”); instead, it has vectorized representations of these concepts that it learned during training, so the query it will use for the lookup will not perfectly match any key in the dictionary. The solution is to compute a similarity measure between the query and each key in the dictionary, and then use the softmax function to convert these similarity scores to weights that add up to 1. As we saw earlier, that’s exactly what the attention layer does. If the key that represents the verb is by far the most similar to the query, then that key’s weight will be close to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the attention layer computes a weighted sum of the corresponding values: if the weight of the “verb” key is close to 1, then the weighted sum will be very close to the representation of the word “played”.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the Keras Attention and AdditiveAttention layers both expect a list as input, containing two or three items: the queries, the keys, and optionally the values. If you do not pass any values, then they are automatically equal to the keys. So, looking at the previous code example again, the decoder outputs are the queries, and the encoder outputs are both the keys and the values. For each decoder output (i.e., each query), the attention layer returns a weighted sum of the encoder outputs (i.e., the keys/values) that are most similar to the decoder output.\n",

    "In a groundbreaking 2017 paper, a team of Google researchers suggested that “Attention Is All You Need”. They created an architecture called the transformer, which significantly improved the state-of-the-art in NMT without using any recurrent or convolutional layers, just attention mechanisms (plus embedding layers, dense layers, normalization layers, and a few other bits and pieces). Because the model is not recurrent, it doesn’t suffer as much from the vanishing or exploding gradients problems as RNNs, it can be trained in fewer steps, it’s easier to parallelize across multiple GPUs, and it can better capture long-range patterns than RNNs. The original 2017 transformer architecture is represented in Figure 16-8.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the left part of Figure 16-8 is the encoder, and the right part is the decoder. Each embedding layer outputs a 3D tensor of shape [batch size, sequence length, embedding size]. After that, the tensors are gradually transformed as they flow through the transformer, but their shape remains the same."

    "If you use the transformer for NMT, then during training you must feed the English sentences to the encoder and the corresponding Spanish translations to the decoder, with an extra SOS token inserted at the start of each sentence. At inference time, you must call the transformer multiple times, producing the translations one word at a time and feeding the partial translations to the decoder at each round, just like we did earlier in the translate() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoder’s role is to gradually transform the inputs—word representations of the English sentence—until each word’s representation perfectly captures the meaning of the word, in the context of the sentence. For example, if you feed the encoder with the sentence “I like soccer”, then the word “like” will start off with a rather vague representation, since this word could mean different things in different contexts: think of “I like soccer” versus “It’s like that”. But after going through the encoder, the word’s representation should capture the correct meaning of “like” in the given sentence (i.e., to be fond of), as well as any other information that may be required for translation (e.g., it’s a verb).\n",
    "\n",
    "The decoder’s role is to gradually transform each word representation in the translated sentence into a word representation of the next word in the translation. For example, if the sentence to translate is “I like soccer”, and the decoder’s input sentence is “<SOS> me gusta el fútbol”, then after going through the decoder, the word representation of the word “el” will end up transformed into a representation of the word “fútbol”. Similarly, the representation of the word “fútbol” will be transformed into a representation of the EOS token.\n",
    "\n",
    "After going through the decoder, each word representation goes through a final Dense layer with a softmax activation function, which will hopefully output a high probability for the correct next word and a low probability for all other words. The predicted sentence should be “me gusta el fútbol <EOS>”.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was the big picture; now let’s walk through Figure 16-8 in more detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, notice that both the encoder and the decoder contain modules that are stacked $N$ times. In the paper, $N = 6$. The final outputs of the whole encoder stack are fed to the decoder at each of these $N$ levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Zooming in, you can see that you are already familiar with most components: there are two embedding layers; several skip connections, each of them followed by a layer normalization layer; several feedforward modules that are composed of two dense layers each (the first one using the ReLU activation function, the second with no activation function); and finally the output layer is a dense layer using the softmax activation function. You can also sprinkle a bit of dropout after the attention layers and the feedforward modules, if needed. Since all of these layers are time-distributed, each word is treated independently from all the others. But how can we translate a sentence by looking at the words completely separately? Well, we can’t, so that’s where the new components come in:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The encoder’s multi-head attention layer updates each word representation by attending to (i.e., paying attention to) all other words in the same sentence. That’s where the vague representation of the word “like” becomes a richer and more accurate representation, capturing its precise meaning in the given sentence. We will discuss exactly how this works shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The decoder’s masked multi-head attention layer does the same thing, but when it processes a word, it doesn’t attend to words located after it: it’s a causal layer. For example, when it processes the word “gusta”, it only attends to the words “<SOS> me gusta”, and it ignores the words “el fútbol” (or else that would be cheating).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The decoder’s upper multi-head attention layer is where the decoder pays attention to the words in the English sentence. This is called cross-attention, not self-attention in this case. For example, the decoder will probably pay close attention to the word “soccer” when it processes the word “el” and transforms its representation into a representation of the word “fútbol”.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The positional encodings are dense vectors (much like word embeddings) that represent the position of each word in the sentence. The $n^{th}$ positional encoding is added to the word embedding of the $n^{th}$ word in each sentence. This is needed because all layers in the transformer architecture ignore word positions: without positional encodings, you could shuffle the input sequences, and it would just shuffle the output sequences in the same way. Obviously, the order of words matters, which is why we need to give positional information to the transformer somehow: adding positional encodings to the word representations is a good way to achieve this."

    "# Positional Encodings\n",
    "A positional encoding is a dense vector that encodes the position of a word within a sentence: the $i^{th}$ positional encoding is added to the word embedding of the $i^{th}$ word in the sentence. The easiest way to implement this is to use an Embedding layer and make it encode all the positions from 0 to the maximum sequence length in the batch, then add the result to the word embeddings. The rules of broadcasting will ensure that the positional encodings get applied to every input sequence. For example, here is how to add positional encodings to the encoder and decoder inputs:"

    "This solution can give the same performance as trainable positional encodings, and it can extend to arbitrarily long sentences without adding any parameters to the model (however, when there is a large amount of pretraining data, trainable positional encodings are usually favored). After these positional encodings are added to the word embeddings, the rest of the model has access to the absolute position of each word in the sentence because there is a unique positional encoding for each position (e.g., the positional encoding for the word located at the 22nd position in a sentence is represented by the vertical dashed line at the top left of Figure 16-9, and you can see that it is unique to that position). Moreover, the choice of oscillating functions (sine and cosine) makes it possible for the model to learn relative positions as well. For example, words located 38 words apart (e.g., at positions $p$ = 22 and $p$ = 60) always have the same positional encoding values in the encoding dimensions $i$ = 100 and $i$ = 101, as you can see in Figure 16-9. This explains why we need both the sine and the cosine for each frequency: if we only used the sine (the blue wave at $i$ = 100), the model would not be able to distinguish positions $p$ = 22 and $p$ = 35 (marked by a cross).\n",

To prevent this matrix from being huge, the input sequences must not be too long (we will discuss how to overcome this limitation later in this chapter). The output of the softmax function has the same shape, but all rows sum up to 1. The final output has a shape of $[n_{\\text{queries}}, d_{\\text{values}}]$: there is one row per query, where each row represents the query result (a weighted sum of the values).\n",

    "If you set `use_scale=True` when creating a `tf.keras.layers.Attention` layer, then it will create an additional parameter that lets the layer learn how to properly downscale the similarity scores.

    "\n",
    "Note that the `Attention` layer’s inputs are just like $Q$, $K$, and $V$, except with an extra batch dimension (the first dimension). Internally, the layer computes all the attention scores for all sentences in the batch with just one call to `tf.matmul(queries, keys)`: this makes it extremely efficient. Indeed, in TensorFlow, if $A$ and $B$ are tensors with more than two dimensions—say, of shape $[2, 3, 4, 5]$ and $[2, 3, 5, 6]$, respectively—then `tf.matmul(A, B)` will treat these tensors as $2 \\times 3$ arrays where each cell contains a matrix, and it will multiply the corresponding matrices: the matrix at the $i^{th}$ row and $j^{th}$ column in $A$ will be multiplied by the matrix at the $i^{th}$ row and $j^{th}$ column in $B$. Since the product of a $4 \\times 5$ matrix with a $5 \\times 6$ matrix is a $4 \\times 6$ matrix, `tf.matmul(A, B)` will return an array of shape $[2, 3, 4, 6]$.\n",

    "But why? What is the intuition behind this architecture? Well, consider once again the word “like” in the sentence “I like soccer”. The encoder was smart enough to encode the fact that it is a verb. But the word representation also includes its position in the text, thanks to the positional encodings, and it probably includes many other features that are useful for its translation, such as the fact that it is in the present tense. In short, the word representation encodes many different characteristics of the word. If we just used a single scaled dot-product attention layer, we would only be able to query all of these characteristics in one shot.\n",

    "The MultiHeadAttention layer accepts an attention_mask argument, which is a Boolean tensor of shape [batch size, max query length, max value length]: for every token in every query sequence, this mask indicates which tokens in the corresponding value sequence should be attended to. We want to tell the MultiHeadAttention layer to ignore all the padding tokens in the values. So, we first compute the padding mask using tf.math.not_equal(encoder_input_ids, 0). This returns a Boolean tensor of shape [batch size, max sequence length]. We then insert a second axis using [:, tf.newaxis], to get a mask of shape [batch size, 1, max sequence length]. This allows us to use this mask as the attention_mask when calling the MultiHeadAttention layer: thanks to broadcasting, the same mask will be used for all tokens in each query. This way, the padding tokens in the values will be ignored correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the layer will compute outputs for every single query token, including the padding tokens. We need to mask the outputs that correspond to these padding tokens. Recall that we used mask_zero in the Embedding layers, and we set supports_masking to True in the PositionalEncoding layer, so the automatic mask was propagated all the way to the MultiHeadAttention layer’s inputs (encoder_in). We can use this to our advantage in the skip connection: indeed, the Add layer supports automatic masking, so when we add Z and skip (which is initially equal to encoder_in), the outputs get automatically masked correctly. Yikes! Masking required much more explanation than code.\n",

    "# An Avalanche of Transformer Models\n",
    "The year 2018 has been called the “ImageNet moment for NLP”. Since then, progress has been astounding, with larger and larger transformer-based architectures trained on immense datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the GPT paper by Alec Radford and other OpenAI researchers once again demonstrated the effectiveness of unsupervised pretraining, like the ELMo and ULMFiT papers before it, but this time using a transformer-like architecture. The authors pretrained a large but fairly simple architecture composed of a stack of 12 transformer modules using only masked multi-head attention layers, like in the original transformer’s decoder. They trained it on a very large dataset, using the same autoregressive technique we used for our Shakespearean char-RNN: just predict the next token. This is a form of self-supervised learning. Then they fine-tuned it on various language tasks, using only minor adaptations for each task. The tasks were quite diverse: they included text classification, entailment (whether sentence A imposes, involves, or implies sentence B as a necessary consequence), similarity (e.g., “Nice weather today” is very similar to “It is sunny”), and question answering (given a few paragraphs of text giving some context, the model must answer some multiple-choice questions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then Google’s BERT paper came out: it also demonstrated the effectiveness of self-supervised pretraining on a large corpus, using a similar architecture to GPT but with nonmasked multi-head attention layers only, like in the original transformer’s encoder. This means that the model is naturally bidirectional; hence the B in BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). Most importantly, the authors proposed two pretraining tasks that explain most of the model’s strength:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Masked language model (MLM)**\n",
    "Each word in a sentence has a 15% probability of being masked, and the model is trained to predict the masked words. For example, if the original sentence is “She had fun at the birthday party”, then the model may be given the sentence “She <mask> fun at the <mask> party” and it must predict the words “had” and “birthday” (the other outputs will be ignored). To be more precise, each selected word has an 80% chance of being masked, a 10% chance of being replaced by a random word (to reduce the discrepancy between pretraining and fine-tuning, since the model will not see <mask> tokens during fine-tuning), and a 10% chance of being left alone (to bias the model toward the correct answer).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next sentence prediction (NSP)**\n",
    "The model is trained to predict whether two sentences are consecutive or not. For example, it should predict that “The dog sleeps” and “It snores loudly” are consecutive sentences, while “The dog sleeps” and “The Earth orbits the Sun” are not consecutive. Later research showed that NSP was not as important as was initially thought, so it was dropped in most later architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is trained on these two tasks simultaneously (see Figure 16-11). For the NSP task, the authors inserted a class token (<CLS>) at the start of every input, and the corresponding output token represents the model’s prediction: sentence B follows sentence A, or it does not. The two input sentences are concatenated, separated only by a special separation token (<SEP>), and they are fed as input to the model. To help the model know which sentence each input token belongs to, a segment embedding is added on top of each token’s positional embeddings: there are just two possible segment embeddings, one for sentence A and one for sentence B. For the MLM task, some input words are masked (as we just saw) and the model tries to predict what those words were. The loss is only computed on the NSP prediction and the masked tokens, not on the unmasked ones."

    "After this unsupervised pretraining phase on a very large corpus of text, the model is then fine-tuned on many different tasks, changing very little for each task. For example, for text classification such as sentiment analysis, all output tokens are ignored except for the first one, corresponding to the class token, and a new output layer replaces the previous one, which was just a binary classification layer for NSP.\n",
    "\n",
    "In February 2019, just a few months after BERT was published, Alec Radford, Jeffrey Wu, and other OpenAI researchers published the GPT-2 paper, which proposed a very similar architecture to GPT, but larger still (with over 1.5 billion parameters!). The researchers showed that the new and improved GPT model could perform zero-shot learning (ZSL), meaning it could achieve good performance on many tasks without any fine-tuning. This was just the start of a race toward larger and larger models: Google’s Switch Transformers (introduced in January 2021) used 1 trillion parameters, and soon much larger models came out, such as the Wu Dao 2.0 model by the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAII), announced in June 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "An unfortunate consequence of this trend toward gigantic models is that only well-funded organizations can afford to train such models: it can easily cost hundreds of thousands of dollars or more. And the energy required to train a single model corresponds to an American household’s electricity consumption for several years; it’s not eco-friendly at all. Many of these models are just too big to even be used on regular hardware: they wouldn’t fit in RAM, and they would be horribly slow. Lastly, some are so costly that they are not released publicly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, ingenious researchers are finding new ways to downsize transformers and make them more data-efficient. For example, the DistilBERT model, introduced in October 2019 by Victor Sanh et al. from Hugging Face, is a small and fast transformer model based on BERT. It is available on Hugging Face’s excellent model hub, along with thousands of others—you’ll see an example later in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "DistilBERT was trained using distillation (hence the name): this means transferring knowledge from a teacher model to a student one, which is usually much smaller than the teacher model. This is typically done by using the teacher’s predicted probabilities for each training instance as targets for the student. Surprisingly, distillation often works better than training the student from scratch on the same dataset as the teacher! Indeed, the student benefits from the teacher’s more nuanced labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many more transformer architectures came out after BERT, almost on a monthly basis, often improving on the state of the art across all NLP tasks: XLNet (June 2019), RoBERTa (July 2019), StructBERT (August 2019), ALBERT (September 2019), T5 (October 2019), ELECTRA (March 2020), GPT3 (May 2020), DeBERTa (June 2020), Switch Transformers (January 2021), Wu Dao 2.0 (June 2021), Gopher (December 2021), GPT-NeoX-20B (February 2022), Chinchilla (March 2022), OPT (May 2022), and the list goes on and on. Each of these models brought new ideas and techniques,34 but I particularly like the T5 paper by Google researchers: it frames all NLP tasks as text-to-text, using an encoder–decoder transformer. For example, to translate “I like soccer” to Spanish, you can just call the model with the input sentence “translate English to Spanish: I like soccer” and it outputs “me gusta el fútbol”. To summarize a paragraph, you just enter “summarize:” followed by the paragraph, and it outputs the summary. For classification, you only need to change the prefix to “classify:” and the model outputs the class name, as text. This simplifies using the model, and it also makes it possible to pretrain it on even more tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least, in April 2022, Google researchers used a new large-scale training platform named Pathways (which we will briefly discuss in Chapter 19) to train a humongous language model named the Pathways Language Model (PaLM), with a whopping 540 billion parameters, using over 6,000 TPUs. Other than its incredible size, this model is a standard transformer, using decoders only (i.e., with masked multi-head attention layers), with just a few tweaks (see the paper for details). This model achieved incredible performance on all sorts of NLP tasks, particularly in natural language understanding (NLU). It’s capable of impressive feats, such as explaining jokes, giving detailed step-by-step answers to questions, and even coding. This is in part due to the model’s size, but also thanks to a technique called Chain of thought prompting, which was introduced a couple months earlier by another team of Google researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In question answering tasks, regular prompting typically includes a few examples of questions and answers, such as: “Q: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now? A: 11.” The prompt then continues with the actual question, such as “Q: John takes care of 10 dogs. Each dog takes .5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. How many hours a week does he spend taking care of dogs? A:”, and the model’s job is to append the answer: in this case, “35.”\n",
    "\n",
    "But with chain of thought prompting, the example answers include all the reasoning steps that lead to the conclusion. For example, instead of “A: 11”, the prompt contains “A: Roger started with 5 balls. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each is 6 tennis balls. 5 + 6 = 11.” This encourages the model to give a detailed answer to the actual question, such as “John takes care of 10 dogs. Each dog takes .5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. So that is 10 × .5 = 5 hours a day. 5 hours a day × 7 days a week = 35 hours a week. The answer is 35 hours a week.” This is an actual example from the paper!\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only does the model give the right answer much more frequently than using regular prompting—we’re encouraging the model to think things through—but it also provides all the reasoning steps, which can be useful to better understand the rationale behind a model’s answer.\n",

    "One of the first applications of attention mechanisms beyond NMT was in generating image captions using visual attention: a convolutional neural network first processes the image and outputs some feature maps, then a decoder RNN equipped with an attention mechanism generates the caption, one word at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each decoder time step (i.e., each word), the decoder uses the attention model to focus on just the right part of the image. For example, in Figure 16-12, the model generated the caption “A woman is throwing a frisbee in a park”, and you can see what part of the input image the decoder focused its attention on when it was about to output the word “frisbee”: clearly, most of its attention was focused on the frisbee."

    "EXPLAINABILITY\n",
    "One extra benefit of attention mechanisms is that they make it easier to understand what led the model to produce its output. This is called explainability. It can be especially useful when the model makes a mistake: for example, if an image of a dog walking in the snow is labeled as “a wolf walking in the snow”, then you can go back and check what the model focused on when it output the word “wolf”. You may find that it was paying attention not only to the dog, but also to the snow, hinting at a possible explanation: perhaps the way the model learned to distinguish dogs from wolves is by checking whether or not there’s a lot of snow around. You can then fix this by training the model with more images of wolves without snow, and dogs with snow. This example comes from a great 2016 paper by Marco Tulio Ribeiro et al. that uses a different approach to explainability: learning an interpretable model locally around a classifier’s prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some applications, explainability is not just a tool to debug a model; it can be a legal requirement—think of a system deciding whether or not it should grant you a loan."

    "When transformers came out in 2017 and people started to experiment with them beyond NLP, they were first used alongside CNNs, without replacing them. Instead, transformers were generally used to replace RNNs, for example, in image captioning models. Transformers became slightly more visual in a 2020 paper by Facebook researchers, which proposed a hybrid CNN–transformer architecture for object detection. Once again, the CNN first processes the input images and outputs a set of feature maps, then these feature maps are converted to sequences and fed to a transformer, which outputs bounding box predictions. But again, most of the visual work is still done by the CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in October 2020, a team of Google researchers released a paper that introduced a fully transformer-based vision model, called a vision transformer (ViT). The idea is surprisingly simple: just chop the image into little 16 × 16 squares, and treat the sequence of squares as if it were a sequence of word representations. To be more precise, the squares are first flattened into 16 × 16 × 3 = 768-dimensional vectors—the 3 is for the RGB color channels—then these vectors go through a linear layer that transforms them but retains their dimensionality. The resulting sequence of vectors can then be treated just like a sequence of word embeddings: this means adding positional embeddings, and passing the result to the transformer. That’s it! This model beat the state of the art on ImageNet image classification, but to be fair the authors had to use over 300 million additional images for training. This makes sense since transformers don’t have as many inductive biases as convolution neural nets, so they need extra data just to learn things that CNNs implicitly assume."

    "An inductive bias is an implicit assumption made by the model, due to its architecture. For example, linear models implicitly assume that the data is, well, linear. CNNs implicitly assume that patterns learned in one location will likely be useful in other locations as well. RNNs implicitly assume that the inputs are ordered, and that recent tokens are more important than older ones. The more inductive biases a model has, assuming they are correct, the less training data the model will require. But if the implicit assumptions are wrong, then the model may perform poorly even if it is trained on a large dataset."

    "Just two months later, a team of Facebook researchers released a paper that introduced data-efficient image transformers (DeiTs). Their model achieved competitive results on ImageNet without requiring any additional data for training. The model’s architecture is virtually the same as the original ViT, but the authors used a distillation technique to transfer knowledge from state-of-the-art CNN models to their model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in March 2021, DeepMind released an important paper that introduced the Perceiver architecture. It is a multimodal transformer, meaning you can feed it text, images, audio, or virtually any other modality. Until then, transformers had been restricted to fairly short sequences because of the performance and RAM bottleneck in the attention layers. This excluded modalities such as audio or video, and it forced researchers to treat images as sequences of patches, rather than sequences of pixels. The bottleneck is due to self-attention, where every token must attend to every other token: if the input sequence has $M$ tokens, then the attention layer must compute an $M × M$ matrix, which can be huge if $M$ is very large. The Perceiver solves this problem by gradually improving a fairly short latent representation of the inputs, composed of $N$ tokens—typically just a few hundred. (The word latent means hidden, or internal.) The model uses cross-attention layers only, feeding them the latent representation as the queries, and the (possibly large) inputs as the values. This only requires computing an $M × N$ matrix, so the computational complexity is linear with regard to $M$, instead of quadratic. After going through several cross-attention layers, if everything goes well, the latent representation ends up capturing everything that matters in the inputs. The authors also suggested sharing the weights between consecutive cross-attention layers: if you do that, then the Perceiver effectively becomes an RNN. Indeed, the shared cross-attention layers can be seen as the same memory cell at different time steps, and the latent representation corresponds to the cell’s context vector. The same inputs are repeatedly fed to the memory cell at every time step. It looks like RNNs are not dead after all!\n",
    "\n",
    "Just a month later, Mathilde Caron et al. introduced DINO, an impressive vision transformer trained entirely without labels, using self-supervision, and capable of high-accuracy semantic segmentation. The model is duplicated during training, with one network acting as a teacher and the other acting as a student. Gradient descent only affects the student, while the teacher’s weights are just an exponential moving average of the student’s weights. The student is trained to match the teacher’s predictions: since they’re almost the same model, this is called self-distillation. At each training step, the input images are augmented in different ways for the teacher and the student, so they don’t see the exact same image, but their predictions must match. This forces them to come up with high-level representations. To prevent mode collapse, where both the student and the teacher would always output the same thing, completely ignoring the inputs, DINO keeps track of a moving average of the teacher’s outputs, and it tweaks the teacher’s predictions to ensure that they remain centered on zero, on average. DINO also forces the teacher to have high confidence in its predictions: this is called sharpening. Together, these techniques preserve diversity in the teacher’s outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a 2021 paper, Google researchers showed how to scale ViTs up or down, depending on the amount of data. They managed to create a huge 2 billion parameter model that reached over 90.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Conversely, they also trained a scaled-down model that reached over 84.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, using only 10,000 images: that’s just 10 images per class!\n",
    "\n",
    "And progress in visual transformers has continued steadily to this day. For example, in March 2022, a paper by Mitchell Wortsman et al. demonstrated that it’s possible to first train multiple transformers, then average their weights to create a new and improved model. This is similar to an ensemble (see Chapter 7), except there’s just one model in the end, which means there’s no inference time penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latest trend in transformers consists in building large multimodal models, often capable of zero-shot or few-shot learning. For example, OpenAI’s 2021 CLIP paper proposed a large transformer model pretrained to match captions with images: this task allows it to learn excellent image representations, and the model can then be used directly for tasks such as image classification using simple text prompts such as “a photo of a cat”. Soon after, OpenAI announced DALL·E, capable of generating amazing images based on text prompts. The DALL·E 2, which generates even higher quality images using a diffusion model (see Chapter 17).\n",
    "\n",
    "In April 2022, DeepMind released the Flamingo paper, which introduced a family of models pretrained on a wide variety of tasks across multiple modalities, including text, images, and videos. A single model can be used across very different tasks, such as question answering, image captioning, and more. Soon after, in May 2022, DeepMind introduced GATO, a multimodal model that can be used as a policy for a reinforcement learning agent (RL will be introduced in Chapter 18). The same transformer can chat with you, caption images, play Atari games, control (simulated) robotic arms, and more, all with “only” 1.2 billion parameters. And the adventure continues!\n"

    "BIAS AND FAIRNESS\n",
    "As the output suggests, this specific classifier loves Indians, but is severely biased against Iraqis. You can try this code with your own country or city. Such an undesirable bias generally comes in large part from the training data itself: in this case, there were plenty of negative sentences related to the wars in Iraq in the training data. This bias was then amplified during the fine-tuning process since the model was forced to choose between just two classes: positive or negative. If you add a neutral class when fine-tuning, then the country bias mostly disappears. But the training data is not the only source of bias: the model’s architecture, the type of loss or regularization used for training, the optimizer; all of these can affect what the model ends up learning. Even a mostly unbiased model can be used in a biased way, much like survey questions can be biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding bias in AI and mitigating its negative effects is still an area of active research, but one thing is certain: you should pause and think before you rush to deploy a model to production. Ask yourself how the model could do harm, even indirectly. For example, if the model’s predictions are used to decide whether or not to give someone a loan, the process should be fair. So, make sure you evaluate the model’s performance not just on average over the whole test set, but across various subsets as well: for example, you may find that although the model works very well on average, its performance is abysmal for some categories of people. You may also want to run counterfactual tests: for example, you may want to check that the model’s predictions do not change when you simply switch someone’s gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the model works well on average, it’s tempting to push it to production and move on to something else, especially if it’s just one component of a much larger system. But in general, if you don’t fix such issues, no one else will, and your model may end up doing more harm than good. The solution depends on the problem: it may require rebalancing the dataset, fine-tuning on a different dataset, switching to another pretrained model, tweaking the model’s architecture or hyperparameters, etc."

    "The pipeline() function uses the default model for the given task. For example, for text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis, at the time of writing, it defaults to distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english—a DistilBERT model with an uncased tokenizer, trained on English Wikipedia and a corpus of English books, and fine-tuned on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank v2 (SST 2) task. It’s also possible to manually specify a different model.
