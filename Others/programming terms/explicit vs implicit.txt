Implicit: something is being done for you automatically. Implicit casting is done automatically when passing a smaller size type to a larger size type (C#):
  int myInt = 9;
  double myDouble = myInt;       // Automatic casting: int to double
  Console.WriteLine(myInt);      // Outputs 9
  Console.WriteLine(myDouble);   // Outputs 9



Explicit: you've written something in the source code to indicate what you want to happen. Explicit casting must be done manually by placing the type in parentheses in front of the value (C#):
  double myDouble = 9.78;
  int myInt = (int) myDouble;    // Manual casting: double to int
  Console.WriteLine(myDouble);   // Outputs 9.78
  Console.WriteLine(myInt);      // Outputs 9
