Cloud computing / Cloud storage
Refers to data and applications being stored and run on the cloud rather than on our local computer.
Cloud is usually a building with a bunch of computers/servers in it. (server=computer that provides services on behalf of clients). It is used for
running applications, storing data, data processing, web hosting.
Purpouse fo companies that sell thier cloud is to provide thier computation power and memory to clients for cash.


Benefits of cloud:
Cost - you do not have to buy hardware, do not have to maintain it, do not have to set it up, dont have to pay electricity...you get the point). Basically
	it is more cost efficient.
Reliability - no matter what, the servis will be always available to you, compared to if you had it at your side and have to repair it if it broke.
Scalability - you only pay for what computation power / memory you actually use at the moment


Major cloud providers:
AWS - amazon web services (1/3 of all cloud business)
Microsoft Azure
Google cloud platform
Alibaba
IBM


Example from real world:
Netfliex uses AWS for nearly all its computing and storage needs.


Cloud computing types:
These depend of what actually customer needs from a cloud provider.
IAAS - infrastructure as a service -- This is a type that you use for renting mainly hardware only.
PAAS - platform as a service -- this is a combination of renting hardware and some software tools
SAAS - software a service -- this is basically renting cloud with every service from hardware to sofware. All you need to do is just connect from a local machine.
	This is the most common service.
