The suffixes in domain names, like `.com`, `.net`, `.org`, `.gov`, and others, are known as top-level domains (TLDs).
Each of these TLDs has a specific intended purpose or represents a certain group of organizations or entities.
Here’s an overview of the meaning and difference between some of the most common TLDs:


### 1. **.com**
- **Meaning**:
Originally short for "commercial," intended for domains registered by commercial organizations.

- **Usage**:
Now the most popular TLD, used by a wide variety of websites both commercial and personal.
It’s often the default choice for businesses because it is widely recognized and easy to remember.



### 2. **.net**
- **Meaning**:
Short for "network," originally intended for organizations involved in networking technologies, such as internet service
 providers and infrastructure companies.

- **Usage**:
While it retains its original designation to some extent, like `.com`, it has become generalized and is used by a
variety of different entities, often as a popular alternative to `.com`.



### 3. **.org**
- **Meaning**: Short for "organization," originally intended for non-commercial organizations or nonprofits.
- **Usage**: It is still favored by non-profits, open-source projects, and communities, but is also used by schools,
communities, and personal projects. There's no restriction on who can register a `.org` domain, so it’s also seen
wider general use.



### 4. **.gov**
- **Meaning**:
Short for "government," and is restricted to government entities.

- **Usage**:
Exclusively used by United States governmental bodies at federal, state, and local levels. This restriction
 helps ensure authenticity and security for governmental sites.



### 5. **.edu**
- **Meaning**:
Short for "education," and is restricted to educational institutions.

- **Usage**:
Primarily used by accredited post-secondary educational institutions in the United States (colleges, universities, and
some high schools). Like `.gov`, its restricted use helps maintain a trusted sphere for educational resources.



### 6. **.mil**
- **Meaning**:
Short for "military," and is restricted to the United States military.

- **Usage**:
Exclusively used by branches of the United States Military. This exclusivity supports security and organizational integrity.


### 7. **.info**
- **Meaning**:
Short for "information".

- **Usage**:
Intended for informational sites. Open for registration to the general public and used by a wide variety of sites, often
 as an alternative when the desired `.com` domain is unavailable.



### 8. **.biz**
- **Meaning**:
Short for "business".

- **Usage**:
Designed as an alternative for businesses when the `.com` domain is taken. It’s open for any business or individual to
register.



### Country Code TLDs (ccTLDs)
In addition to these generic TLDs, there are country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) such as `.uk` (United Kingdom),
`.de` (Germany), `.ca` (Canada), and many others. These are generally used or reserved by a country, sovereign state,
or dependent territory and are regulated by the relevant local registries.



Each TLD can carry certain implications about the nature or origin of the website, affecting user perceptions and
sometimes search engine optimization (SEO). It’s important for businesses and organizations to consider these factors
when choosing a domain name to ensure it aligns with their identity and objectives.
