Serves as a identification of computers, devices, webpages in a network via numbers such as ip addresses.

In my words:
DNS makes our life easier because instead of memorising all the ip addresses we are allowed to work
with text addresses that DNS server matches with corresponding ip addresses in its database/dictionary.

If the ip address based on text address cannot be found locally in our browser, operating system, cache the
pc will send request out to our internet service provider, to check there what is the corresponding match
for our text address request. If the isp 'resolver' does not find anything in its cache, it will send request
to the 'root server', which are basically on the top of DNS hierarchy. There are 13 sets of root servers around
the world and are operated by 12 different organisations. Each set has its own ip address. Actually the root 
server will not know the ip address based on our text input, but will point our internet service provider's 
'resolver' to the 'top level domain server' which stores the top level domains such as .com, .net, .org, etc. 
The top level domain server will then point the resolver to the final destination based on which domain is
our text addres request in. If it is in .com domain, the resolver will be pointed to 'authoritative name server'
that will know everything about the domain, including ip addresses. This 'authoritative name server' will
then return the ip address to the 'resolver', which will return it to you machine.
When the isp 'resolver' recieves request for ip address from your previous request, it will store it in its
cache memory, in case the address was needed again, this will save time, because resolver does not need to
go again and search trhough all the servers as above to retrieve the ip address.
