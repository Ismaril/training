Wifi6
Is the latest wireless standart today, released in 2019.
It is the sucessor of Wifi5 802.11ac standart.
Has higher speed compared to wifi5, increase from 3.5Gbps to 9.6Gbps. The speed 9.6Gbps is divided between all conected devices.
OFMDA - orthogonal frequency-division multiple access -- technology that lowers latency and delivers the data to multiple devices more efficiently.
MU-MIMO - multiple user - multiple input multiple output - technology that allows communication with more devices at the same time. (expalined in separate file)
	Also MU-MIMO in wifi6 allows communication with multiple devices in upload and dowload. It allows 12 devices communicate in the exact same moment.
Improved beamforming - strenghtens the signal in specific directions (explained in another file)
BSS - basic service set coloring -- When you have two wifi routers together with your neigbour close together, they can interfere with each other, which might lead
	to lags, datalosss etc. BSS alows coloring/marking of network so that it is possible to distinguish networks from each other.
Has WPA3, the latest security protocol.
IT is able to broadcast in 3 separate frequency bands - 2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and 6Ghz.
If you have 15-20 devices connected to a router, it definitely makes sense to buy wifi6.
In order to reap all benefits of wifi6, the connected devices must also suport this technology.

The main goal:
Increase the number of devices which could be connected into router.
Avoid interference.
