The IEEE 802.11 standards are a family of specifications for wireless local area network (WLAN)
communications established by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).
These standards define the protocols for setting up and implementing wireless network communications
in various frequency bands, including 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.
Below is an overview of the major IEEE 802.11 standards and their specific characteristics:

### 1. IEEE 802.11-1997 (802.11 legacy)
- **Frequency**: 2.4 GHz
- **Speed**: Up to 2 Mbps
- **Notes**: This is the original version of the standard, often referred to simply as 802.11.
It is rarely used today.

### 2. IEEE 802.11a
- **Frequency**: 5 GHz
- **Speed**: Up to 54 Mbps
- **Notes**: Introduced in 1999, this standard provides a higher frequency compared to the original
802.11, which results in less interference and higher data rates, but it has a shorter range.

### 3. IEEE 802.11b
- **Frequency**: 2.4 GHz
- **Speed**: Up to 11 Mbps
- **Notes**: Also introduced in 1999, this standard improves on the original by offering higher data
 rates. It is more susceptible to interference due to its operation in the crowded 2.4 GHz band.

### 4. IEEE 802.11g
- **Frequency**: 2.4 GHz
- **Speed**: Up to 54 Mbps
- **Notes**: Introduced in 2003, 802.11g is backward compatible with 802.11b and offers higher data
rates.

### 5. IEEE 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)
- **Frequency**: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz
- **Speed**: Up to 600 Mbps
- **Notes**: Introduced in 2009, this standard, also known as Wi-Fi 4,
incorporates Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) technology to increase speed and range.

### 6. IEEE 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5)
- **Frequency**: 5 GHz
- **Speed**: Up to several Gbps
- **Notes**: Released in 2013, 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) expands upon 802.11n with wider channels,
more spatial streams, and higher-order modulation (up to 256-QAM). It significantly increases
throughput and performance.

### 7. IEEE 802.11ad
- **Frequency**: 60 GHz
- **Speed**: Up to 7 Gbps
- **Notes**: Introduced in 2012, this standard is known for very high data rates and extremely low
latency but has a limited range and cannot effectively penetrate walls.

### 8. IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)
- **Frequency**: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz
- **Speed**: Higher than 802.11ac
- **Notes**: Released in 2019, 802.11ax, or Wi-Fi 6, improves efficiency, capacity, and performance
in dense or congested environments. It uses technologies such as OFDMA, MU-MIMO, and 1024-QAM to
enhance throughput.

### 9. IEEE 802.11ay
- **Frequency**: 60 GHz
- **Speed**: Up to 20-40 Gbps
- **Notes**: This is an enhancement over 802.11ad, aimed at providing even higher data rates and
improved protocol efficiency.

### Future Developments
- **IEEE 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7)**: Expected to be the next generation in Wi-Fi standards, focusing on
even higher data rates and improved latency.

Each of these standards addresses specific needs and environments, from improving data rate speeds
to enhancing coverage and efficiency. They are continually refined to accommodate new technologies
and increasing demands for wireless network performance and reliability.


Notes by me:
WI-FI 6
Is the latest wireless standard today, released in 2019.
It is the successor of Wifi5 802.11ac standard.
Has higher speed compared to wifi5, increase from 3.5Gbps to 9.6Gbps.
The speed 9.6Gbps is divided between all connected devices.
OFMDA - orthogonal frequency-division multiple access -- technology that lowers latency and delivers
the data to multiple devices more efficiently.
MU-MIMO - multiple user - multiple input multiple output - technology that allows communication
with more devices at the same time. (explained in separate file)
Also MU-MIMO in wifi6 allows communication with multiple devices in upload and download.
It allows 12 devices communicate in the exact same moment.
Improved beam-forming - strengthens the signal in specific directions (explained in another file)
BSS - basic service set coloring -- When you have two Wi-Fi routers together with your neighbour
close together, they can interfere with each other, which might lead to lags, data loss etc.
BSS allows coloring/marking of network so that it is possible to distinguish networks from each other.
Has WPA3, the latest security protocol.
IT is able to broadcast in 3 separate frequency bands - 2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and 6Ghz.
If you have 15-20 devices connected to a router, it definitely makes sense to buy wifi6.
In order to reap all benefits of wifi6, the connected devices must also support this technology.
