APIPA - Automatic Private IP Addressing
This is a system that is used when your computer cannot reach DHCP server. (lets suppose that the DHCP server is not in your router). This means
that every computer on a local network will automatically assign an ip address by itself. To make sure that the ip addresses are not the same, the computer
will send ARP message other computers wheter someone is using the picked ip address, if no computer replies that the ip address is already taken, it will
be assigned. Once the computers on the local network have their ip addresses set they can comunicate with each other on local network. However, they cannot
communicate with the internet or other networks/different subnet. In the meantime, the computers will still be checking for DHCP server, if it is running
again, if yes those addreses are disgared and DHCP will assign new addresses as usual.


The range for self assignment is:
169.254.0.1 - 169.254.255.254
and Subnetmask 255.255.0.0


If the ip address was assigned by the computer it self, you would see it in "ipconfig" command returned values as "Autoconfiguration ipv4 address: 169.254.*.*"
