Firewall
Firewall is a system that is designed to prevent unauthorised access from entering a private network.
It gives access to wanted traffic and blocks unwanted traffic.
Firewall can be of two types. One type is that the firewall is a filter between outer internet and local network. (network based firewall)
The oter is a filter before a device, for example computer (called host based firewall, installed directly on computer).
Firewall comes actually from real world - fire wall is an actual wall in a building that prevents spreading fire in a building.
Firewall works by allowing or denying access by "access control list". The list can look like this:

Permision, IP address, Protocol, Destination, Port
Allow, 54.21.66.112, TCP, ANY, 80
Deny, 10.10.0.1, UDP, ANY, 3368
Allow, ANY, TCP, ANY, 110


Firewall can be directly build in in routers. It can also be as a standalone hardware, which is used as a network based firewall. 
(used by large organisations). Firewall can also be cloud based.
