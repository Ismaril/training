Proxy server
Proxy server is a server that retrieves data (such as webpage) on the internet on behalf of a user.
Normally when you make a request, your pc sends it via your router out to the internet till it reaches the website and it will get back
to you. With a proxy server, your pc makes a request to a proxy server and the server will decide whether it needs to make a request
to the webpage on your behalf or wheter is checks for example its cache of previously visited sites. Once the proxy server has the data
it will send it back to your computer/device.

Benefits of proxy servers.
Privacy (Your company at work might actually keep logs of visited pages on its proxy server...so privacy kind of...). Without proxy server
your public IP address is visible.
Speed & Saves bandwith. (Proxy server might provide data from its cache, instead of making requests to the webpage)
Activity logging. (This might be useful for the owner of proxy server, the server will keep logs of visited sites and the time spent on them)
Possible to block certain websites, not to allow clients to access them via your proxy server (if you are proxy admin)

Negatives of proxy servers
Proxy server cannot encrypt data.
