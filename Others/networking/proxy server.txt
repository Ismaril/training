Proxy server
Proxy server is a server that retrieves data (such as webpage) on the internet on behalf of a user.
Normally when you make a request, your pc sends it via your router out to the internet till it
reaches the website and it will get back to you. With a proxy server, your pc makes a request to a
proxy server and the server will decide whether it needs to make a request to the webpage on your
behalf or whether is checks for example its cache of previously visited sites.
Once the proxy server has the data it will send it back to your computer/device.

Benefits of proxy servers:
Privacy (Your company at work might actually keep logs of visited pages on its proxy
server...so privacy kind of...). Without proxy server your public IP address is visible.
Speed & Saves bandwidth. (Proxy server might provide data from its cache, instead of making requests
to the webpage) Activity logging. (This might be useful for the owner of proxy server,
the server will keep logs of visited sites and the time spent on them) Possible to block certain
websites, not to allow clients to access them via your proxy server (if you are proxy admin)


Example of forward proxy:
Your PC --------------->request (11.22.33.44)--------------->proxy server--------------->request (22.33.44.55)---------->Website
11.22.33.44		           (your ip)		                 22.33.44.55		           (proxy ip visible)
Your Public IP						                       Proxy IP Address

PROXIES IN GENERAL
A proxy server is an intermediate server that sits between a client (such as a computer or mobile
device) and another server (such as a website) from which a user or client is requesting a service.
The main functions of a proxy server are to relay requests, deliver data, and sometimes to anonymize
 the identity of the requesting party. Here are the key aspects of a proxy server:

1. **Relaying Requests**:
When a client makes a request (for example, accesses a website), the request is sent to the proxy
server first. The proxy server then forwards the request to the intended server.
Once the proxy receives the response, it sends it back to the client, appearing as if it
originated from the proxy server itself.

2. **Anonymity and Privacy**:
By hiding the real IP address of the client, a proxy server enhances privacy and security.
The destination server sees the IP address of the proxy server instead of the client.
This can be useful for various reasons, including bypassing geo-restrictions or IP bans.

3. **Caching**:
Proxy servers can also cache (store) copies of frequently accessed web resources.
This reduces latency and bandwidth usage because the proxy can serve cached content directly without
accessing the destination server again.

4. **Content Filtering**:
Proxies can also be used to monitor and control the information being accessed or sent by network
users. This can be useful in corporate environments, educational institutions, or within countries
that want to control the information their citizens access.

5. **Bypassing Filters and Firewalls**:
Sometimes, proxies are used to bypass network filters and firewalls, particularly in environments
where internet access is restricted or heavily censored.

6. **Load Balancing**:
Some proxies also serve to distribute incoming requests evenly across a number of servers,
which can increase performance and reliability of the services.

Proxies can operate at different levels of network protocols, with common types being HTTP proxies,
HTTPS proxies, and SOCKS proxies. Depending on their configuration, proxies can be transparent
(disclosing to servers that they are proxies), anonymous (hiding this information), or distorting
(sending a false IP address).
Overall, proxy servers play a crucial role in improving network performance, security, and user privacy.


REVERSE PROXY
A reverse proxy is a type of proxy server that sits in front of one or more web servers and forwards
client (e.g., web browser) requests to those web servers. While a regular proxy server
(often called a forward proxy) is used by clients to access any number of servers across the
internet, a reverse proxy is typically used by servers to help handle incoming requests. Here are
some key functions and benefits of a reverse proxy:

1. **Load Balancing**:
One of the primary uses of a reverse proxy is to distribute client requests across a pool of
servers. This can balance the load, prevent any one server from becoming a bottleneck, enhance
resource utilization, and improve the responsiveness and reliability of applications.

2. **Web Acceleration**:
Reverse proxies can compress inbound and outbound data, cache static content, and use SSL
termination (handling encrypted traffic) to speed up web traffic. This reduces the load on web
servers and speeds up the response time for users.

3. **Security and Anonymity**:
By intercepting requests directed at your backend servers, a reverse proxy can act as an additional
 layer of defense against security attacks. It can also obscure the identities and characteristics
  of your backend servers, providing anonymity to prevent targeted attacks.

4. **SSL Termination**:
A reverse proxy can manage SSL/TLS encryption and decryption, which offloads a significant
processing task from the web servers. This is known as SSL termination, where the proxy handles
 encrypted traffic, decrypts it, and then sends the unencrypted traffic to the web servers.
 The responses from the web servers are encrypted by the proxy before being sent back to the client.

5. **Content Filtering and Web Application Firewall (WAF)**:
Reverse proxies can also perform content filtering, blocking incoming attacks and managing data
flow to and from the backend servers. Many reverse proxies include functionalities similar to a
Web Application Firewall (WAF), which can inspect incoming traffic to block SQL injection,
cross-site scripting (XSS), and other types of attacks.

6. **Centralized Authentication**:
They can provide a central point for authentication services, allowing users to authenticate
themselves to the proxy, which then allows access to multiple services behind it without additional
authentication. This can simplify the security model and reduce overhead.

7. **Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB)**:
For organizations with multiple data centers, a reverse proxy can direct users to the nearest or
least busy server, improving load handling and reducing response times globally.

Overall, reverse proxies are powerful tools that can enhance performance, security, and
manageability of server environments, making them crucial in modern web architecture, especially in
large-scale, high-traffic scenarios.
