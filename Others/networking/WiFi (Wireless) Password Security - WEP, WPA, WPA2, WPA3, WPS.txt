WEP - wired equivalent privacy
Developed in 1999.
Earliest security protocol for wireless network.
Uses 40bit encryption key.
Not much secure and easily hackable.
No longer supported by new routers.


WPA - wifi protected access
Uses stronger encryption "TKIP" (temporal key integrity protocol), meaning it dynamically changes its keys.
Also has some vulnerabilities.
Is used today in situations where there is a need to communicate with older devices.

WPA2
Stronger security than WPA.
Uses AES (advanced encryption standart) instead of TKIP.
It is todays standart of encryption.
It is possible that new routers will have an option WPA + WPA2. That is a configuration in router that will use both security protocols
at the same time. It is due to compatibility reasons. Older devices will connect via WPA while new devices via WPA2. Note that both
protocols will use their own encryption, meaning TKIP in case of WPA will be more vulnerable.
If you know that you use only modern devices, the best option is to use WPA2 with AES.

WPA3
Since 2018.
The most recent protocol with best encryption.


WPS - wifi protected setup
This protocol is designed for people who are no tech.
On router there might be a WPS button (this is why this method is called "push button method") which you press and thats it. Then you press
a WPS button on the device you want to connect to your network (like printer). Both devices will automatically get paired and connected.
Or you can use a "PIN" method, to insert a pin into WPS client, it the device you want to connect has a WPS PIN.
So to sum the WPS up, the main focus is simplicity here.


Access control / MAC filter
In router settings you can add permissions to join or deny connection to your router based on MAC address.
