ping command (here used in cmd)
Used for testing network connectivity, network interface card (on your pc), DNS name resolution issues. 

You can ping any network host/device no matter if its in LAN or WAN. (such as server, router, printer, ...)
If you ping an address and you get a response, then it means that there is a conectivity.
If there is no reply, it means that there is no network connectivity. (there can be serveral reason, explained below)
	Requests timed out. (device/host is powerd down or the device's/host's firewall does not let you in)
	Packet loss. (lot of traffice on the network, interference, faulty hardware such as bad cables, faulty network card, faulty modem, ...)
	Destination unreachable. (the host/device cannot be found)


Example from real world.
Customer complains that he cannot access any website. Before you check any hardware, just try a few ping commands first. Try to ping a website like 
"ping google.com" (besides connectivity you are also testing if DNS works, by inserting name of the destination instead of ip address). If the ping
is successfull then we know that we are connected to the internet and we do not have to check hardware. This means the customer has a problem in
software and we can go checking in that direction.


Loop back test (test your own network card on your pc)
"ping localhost"
If the ping was successful then you know that the network card is working ok.
