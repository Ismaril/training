VLAN - virtual local area network

Analogy example, if you take one switch and divide it into two halfs, you got two different LANs. If you do this
"virtually" you get VLAN. This means that in real life we can have only one switch and divide it for example
into three virtual switches. This means that those 3 switches are 'isolated' and they will not have possibility
to share data. Application for this can be found for example in business, where you want different departments
not to have access to their networks/data. Also it can save some network traffic. It makes a network simpler, meaning
you do not need to have physically many switches, which would you otherwise need, when you wanted to connect those
different departments.

So to sum it up, you got one huge switch with 30 ports. Now you can take any ports you wish and assign them to
VLAN. You can create as many separate VLANs as you want.

Subnet vs VLAN
They basically solve the same problem, but in different ways.
Subnet is a logical division of an IP network. Every subnet gets separated by a router.
With VLAN you can plug multiple device into the same switch and virtually separate them into
different networks.
