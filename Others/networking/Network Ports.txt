Network Ports
A port is not a physical connection, it is a logical connection that is used by programms and services to exchange information.
A port specifically determines which program or service on a computer or server is going to be used. (such as email, ftp, webpage)
Ports have a unique number which identifies them, in range from 0-65535. The are assigned by IANA (internet assigned number authority)
Common ports are 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 21 (FTP), 25 (Email)
A port is always associated with an ip address. 66.94.34.13:21 (the part before ":" is an ip address, the part after it is port number)
Ip address determines a location of that computer/server, port determines which service is going to be used at that computer/server.


Real life example:
You enter an address into your browser, the text address is then converted by DNS into an ip address. Also since you are using a web browser, it automatically appends a port 80 or port 443 to an ip address and sends it
out to the internet to establish a connection with a destination. Once the computer/server is found by its ip, the computer/server now knows what it needs to do, since with ip address also arrived a port number
which describes which service we want to use.


Netstat
Used as a cmd command to chech active connections with remote computers/servers.

					provide to you.

TCP		192.168.0.11:80		12.34.56.78:50252	Established
		0.0.0.0:80 		0.0.0.0:0		Listening
If you see that your local address has port 80 or anything from the most used ports, that means that your computer acts as a server. For example if you see, that tere is an 80 appended to your ip address
this means that your computer can provide services to other computers by providing a HTTP webpage, hosted at your pc.



Port number categories (3 of them)
System ports / Well known ports
0 - 1023
These are the most common ports that are used all the time, like for email services, webpages etc.
Used at servers.

User / Registered ports
1024 - 49151
These are ports that can be registered by companies and developers for a particular service.
Example: 1102 (Adobe server), 1433 (Microsoft SQL server), 1527 (Oracle), etc...
Used at servers.

Dynamic / Private ports
49152 - 65535
These are client side ports that are free to use.
These are the ports that are temporarily assigned by your computer to your computer, during a session.
Used locally, for example your computer which wants to access some service out on the internet.
