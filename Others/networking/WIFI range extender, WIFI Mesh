RANGE EXTENDER
WIFI range extender is used to extend the range of the original source of the signal in your home.
This means that you gonna place the extender somewhere in the place which has about 50% (or
depending what you actually need, this number was just an estimate to give you a point) of
the original signal strength. This way the extender will be able to catch the signal and extend it
to the place where the original signal is weak or not available at all. Keep in mind however
that the extender does not extend the original signal. The extender is actually a new network
with its own SSID and password. The extender is connected to the original network and it
extends the signal of the original network. This means that you will have two networks in your
home. The original network and the extended network. (You will see two networks in your list of
available networks on your device).

From my point of view, this is not that much convenient because your device will have to switch
between the networks when you move around your home.

MESH NETWORK
Mesh network is a network of multiple transmission nodes which are connected to each other and they
create a single network. This means that you will have only one network in your home. (Seems like
having a WIFI router is not necessary, because you need to just plug the first mesh node with
ethernet) Just place the nodes around your home.
You can now just move around the house, and your device will allways connect to the nearest node
seamlessly.
