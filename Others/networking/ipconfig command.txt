ipconfig command
It is a tool that displays TCP/IP network configuration of network adapters on windows computer.

host name - name of your pc
ipv4 - ip version 4, private ip address at local network
ip6 - ip version 6 (will replace ipv4), unique ip of all devices
subnetmask - defines what part of ip address is local and nonlocal.
defaultgateway - ip address of a router (modem/router combination)
lease obtained/ expiration - time how long you will keep your current ipv4 address
physical address - MAC address of our pc network card
DHCP enabled - assignment of ip addresses to connected devices automatically
DHCP server - same address as our router (if it supports it)
DNS server - a server that transforms text (name of website) to an ip address.

If your pc was connected only to a modem, you would have the same ip addres visible at your pcs
ipv4. Nowadays you are connected to a router which has private and public ip adress.


"ipconfig -displaydns"
This shows us dns cache at our computer. There are kept matching name of sites to their ip addresses. (This allows us to save time, by not
sending request to external DNS server for pages we visited recently)
record name - the website
time to live - countdown when the record will be deleted from DNS cache
a (host) record - ip address of that website

"ipconfig -flushdns"
Used to delete DNS cache at our computer.
Useful if you want to make sure that there is no browsing history. Also if you suspect that a hacker infiltrated you DNS chache (DNS spoofing)
and assigned incorrect ip addresses to the names of websites you visited. (You might get routed on a completely different site/location)
You can also flush your DNS if you suspect that the website changed its ip address and your DNS cache has not updated yet. (storing 
still the old address)
