PAN - personal area network
Example is your pc connected to your phone via:
bluetooth, infrared, USB cable
used for transmition of small files, like music, documents photos etc


LAN - local area network
LAN is a group of devices - computers, servers, switches, routers, printers,... that are located in the same building such as office
or your home.
Connected devices can be via Ethernet cable like RJ45.


WLAN - wireless local area network
WLAN is just like LAN but without using calbes.


CAN - campus area network
CAN is a network that connects two or more LANs together. Example could be connected buildings at University where each building has
its own LAN, but the buildings are at the same location (I guess this is not a requirement).


MAN - metropolitan area network
This is bigger CAN. It connects objects at larger scale in city. It can span across several buildings of blocks. Data are transmitted
via optic fibres.


SAN - storage area network
This setup is not really based on physical location as cases above. It is rather huge network by itself managed by huge companies
that provide data storage or services. This system on a physical level be just in one building but it will contain multiple disk
arrays, switches, servers etc...


WAN - wide area network
This basically connects huge clusters together. Could be connection across continets. Basically this is world wide web.
