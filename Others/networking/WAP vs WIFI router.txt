WIFI router
Is stand alone or is one unit with modem.
Provides internet access in local area network through cable and wirelessly.
It is used in homes or small offices.
Has firewall.
Has DHCP service.
Has WAN port (wide area network a.k.a. internet). This is a port where you plug in cable from the modem (...just cable from internet). 
Has usually 4 ports for ethernet connection. (home usage type)

WAP - wireless access point
This is a device that can be optionally used to act as a new transmitor of wireless data from parent wifi router. The WAP connects directly
to a router via ethernet cable. You can place multiple WAPs and link them all physically into the same router. 
It makes sense to place thouse WAPs strategically, so that the network has highest wireless range.
So once you got setup across your building ready, this makes management of that network a lot easier compared to when you would 
replace those WAPs by other routers. So in situation when there would be multiple routers on the same level connected to one parent
router, it would add a unnecessary complexity. If you wanted to make a change, you would have to get into each single router 
settings. Now in the case where we have the WAPs, the change can be done only in the parent router. All those WAPs are basically an
extension of the single router.
Does not have firewall.
Does not have DHCP service.
