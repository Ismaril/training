HTTP - hyper text transfer protocol
This is a protocol used for wieving web pages on the internet.
For example when you type in the internet browser google.com, http is automatically added in front of it.
In HTTP the data transmition is not encrypted.


HTTPS - hyper text transfer protocol secured
This protocol makes sure that the data is encrypted.
You should only insert sensitive data (for eaxmple like credit cards when shoppin) at HTTPS webpages.
Lot of the websites nowdays are HTTPS by default. Also google gives penality with its search engine to HTTP sites.

SSL - secure sockets layer
SSL is digital certificate which is used by HTTPS sites to autentificate themselves to the client. 
It is used to increase security on the net.
So when you as a client want to acess a website, the website has to identify itself by sending you a SSL digital certificate. Your
internet browser will then check the certificate. If all is ok, the session can start.

TLS - transport layer security
TLS does the same as SSL, but is the latest industry standart.
