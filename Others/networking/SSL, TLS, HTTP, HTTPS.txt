HTTP - hyper text transfer protocol
This is a protocol used for viewing web pages on the internet.
For example when you type in the internet browser google.com, http/https is automatically added in front of it.
In HTTP the data transmission is not encrypted.


HTTPS - hyper text transfer protocol secured
This protocol makes sure that the data is encrypted.
You should only insert sensitive data (for example like credit cards when shoppin) at HTTPS webpages.
Lot of the websites nowadays are HTTPS by default. Also google gives penalty with its search engine to HTTP sites.
The "S" in HTTPS means that the HTTP is secured by SSL or TLS. This means that there is a check
of certificate of the website (certificate issued by certificate authority)
and most importantly the data is encrypted.

SSL - secure sockets layer
SSL is digital certificate which is used by HTTPS sites to authenticate themselves to the client.
It is used to increase security on the net.
So when you as a client want to access a website,
the website has to identify itself by sending you a SSL digital certificate.
Your internet browser will then check the certificate. If all is ok, the session can start.
On top of that the data is encrypted.

TLS - transport layer security
TLS does the same as SSL, but is the latest industry standard.
