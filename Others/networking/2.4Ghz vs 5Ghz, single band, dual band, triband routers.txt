The data transmitted over wifi are radiowaves.

2.4Ghz router
This type of routers are single band because the transmit only via 2.4ghz.
The problem is that 2.4Ghz is a range that is used by other devices like bluetooth, microwave, cordless phones and others. That means
that there might be an interference on that frequency and the data can easily not arrive at destination, or the signal might be lower.
If there is a problem with interference, there is a possibility to switch channel in your router. (but the success is not guaranteed)
This router transmits data at lower speed but has higher range.

5Ghz router
Some models can be dual band, meaning the can also transmit at 2.4Ghz.
Has figher frequency, that means it has higher speed, but shorter range.
Since it is higher range/frequency there is not much interference (ruseni) at the moment.
Has more channels.


Triband router
It is a router that can transmit via 2.4Ghz and has two bands of 5Ghz. Meaning there are in total three bands through which 
can the communication be done. This is an advantage to network traffic and interference.
Smart connect - it is a system that makes sure in the triband router, that newly connected device is connected to a band
where it can be maximally effective. This means that it will automatically connect older pcs, phones, wireless printers to 2.4Ghz
and newer devices to either of 5Ghz bands. If there are about 10-15 devices connected to your current router, it makes definetely
sense to buy a triband router.
