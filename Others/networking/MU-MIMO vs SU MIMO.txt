These technologies are used in WIFI routers. It specifies how many devices can connect at the same time.


MU-MIMO - multiuser-multiple input multiple output
Technology used in modern routers.
Introduced with the 802.11ac wave 2 wireless standart.
Works only in 5Ghz in WIFI5.
Only affects download, not upload.
Allows multiple wireless devices to communicate with a wifi at the same time.
Router must specifically state that it suports it else it does not have it. Devices connected to MU-MIMO must also support MU-MIMO,
modern phones etc do support that.
 


SU-MIMO - singleuser-multiuser-multiple input multiple output
Technology used in older 2.4Ghz routers, but still used today.
Devices that want to comunicate with this router have to wait for their turn of communication. The communication is possible only with
one device at a time. The router supports multiple connected devices to it, but they have to wait until current communication is done
with currently communicating device. If there are more devices connected to the router, it can cause congestion, therefore the waiting
periods of each device will be longer at you will feel it on worse network speed at each device.
Works on 'first come, first server' basis.
Versions:
2x2 - two antenas for two simultaneous communications
3x3 - three antenas for three simultaneous communications
4x4 - four antenas for four simultaneous communications
Of course, when you connect more devices into 4x4 router, no problem but the 5th device will have to wait, till its its turn.


Beamforming
This is a technology used by routers to direct a signal in certain direction (actually multiple directions but with stronger signal).
You can imagine that by comparing it to flashlight and its direct lightbeam, compared to lantern (non-beamforming) 
that spreads light to all directions but has weaker light. Modern 5Ghz routers use beamforming, while older 2.4Ghz 
routers release signal into all directions.
