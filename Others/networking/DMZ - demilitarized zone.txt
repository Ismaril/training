DMZ - demilitarized zone
DMZ is used to improve security of a network by segregading some devices from that network infront of and behind firewall.

Example what we want to avoid and how to fix it:
Lets say that you got business which provides web and email services. All these servers all that comes with it are behind firewall.
Now once the client from the internet wants to connect to the web server, the firewall will let the user in to access it. 
But this might be a problem for the whole network because once the outter client is behind firewall, he can theoretially access
other devices in that network or plant a virus inside. This is a risk for owner of that local network. To solve this problem the 
web and email server would be actually placed in front of firewall. Now the users can access the web and mail services but will
not be allowed to access the infrastructure behind the firewall. These two servers are now in DMZ (also known as perimeter network).
This perimeter network can partly be used as a form of vanguard for potential malitious activities before they get to firewall.
The most secure network would be if you added second firewall after the router. Now the setup would look like this:
Internet---local router---firewall---web and mail servers---firewall---remaining private network

FYI:
In case you ever had console, you can set it up as DMZ to route all trafic to your console as DMZ host. It is often done because
firewall might filter out some ports and you are not gonna be able to connect to a game. In this case you should set up static ip address to your
console. So in this setup the router will act as firewall and all trafic will be routed into your console. This adds a layer of
protection to all other devices that are connected to the router.
