ARP - address resolution protocol

Is used to resolve physical addresses (MAC) to ip addresses. MAC address is unique for each physical device on the 
world. When a device on a local network needs to communicate with another device on a local area network, it needs to know the MAC
address of the other device. 

Ip address is used to locate a device on a network or locate networks.
MAC address is what identifies uniquely each device on a local network.

You can use arp -a in cmd to check arp cache on your local machine. There will be stored addresses
with which your computer either communicated or atleast the devices somehow announced themselves.

When a computer wants to communicate on a local net, it will send out request: Who is an ip address xx.xx.xx.xx?
Some pc will respond that it is their ip address and together with it being identified via ip, the device will
provide also a MAC address (it will send its mac address to the requesting device). The requesting device will
then store mac addresses from previous requests in its cache for better efficiency. Once the requesting device
has a mac address of another device, the communication can start.
