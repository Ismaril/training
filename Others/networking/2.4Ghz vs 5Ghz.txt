The data transmitted over wifi are radiowaves.

2.4Ghz router
This type of routers are single band because the transmit only via 2.4ghz.
The problem is that 2.4Ghz is a range that is used by other devices like bluetooth, microwave, cordless phones and others. That means
that there might be an interference on that frequency and the data can easily not arrive at destination, or the signal might be lower.
If there is a problem with interference, there is a possibility to switch channel in your router. (but the success is not guaranteed)
This router transmits data at lower speed but has higher range.

5Ghz router
Some models can be dual band, meaning the can also transmit at 2.4Ghz.
Has figher frequency, that means it has higher speed, but shorter range.
Since it is higher range/frequency there is not much interference (ruseni) at the moment.
