These protocols are used for retrieving emails from a server.

When using email client you can specify which one of these two protocols you want to use.


POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3)
Is the simplest of the two protocols because it only downloads mails from a server to a machine.
It downloads always one mail to one machine. Meaning it downloads to your machine only things that are
in your inbox folder on a server. Meaning if you are connected to a mail server with
more devices, you will not be able to acces the one mail because it was sent only to one machine and moreover
once the mail is sent, it is always deleted from a server. Since all the mails are phisically downloaded,
you will be able to view the even without internet connection. It has an advantage for server, because it saves space.
There are disadvantages also, that the data could be more easily lost in case of some problem. Also there is
a higher chance of virus infection because the mails are fully downloaded.


IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)
Imap makes sure that the emails in all folders in your account on the server are accessible to all your devices
connected. It automatically updates every change that happens either on server or any of your connected machines. 
It however sends only caches of mails, meaning you will not be able to access everything in your local machines
if there is no internet connection.
