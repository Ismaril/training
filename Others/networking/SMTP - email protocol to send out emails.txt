SMTP - (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

(Sending mail to people) - just to remember a shortcut, not actual description....

SMTP is used to send out mails.

When you send out email, it travels to the SMTP server. For example if you are using services of google the mail will
travel to smtp.gmail.com. This server will then also use SMTP to send the mail to the server to which your recipient is a client.
Now it is up to the recipient to log in into his email account program and the email will be downloaded from a server to recipients pc via
POP or IMAP protocols. Or they can just check the email in online service.

SMTP uses TCP protocol, meaning it guarantess delivery of the email. In case the address does not exist...etc the mail will not be 
delivered and you will get notification about that in your inbox.
