DNS
To recap, DNS converts internet address like google.com into ip address, because communication is led through numbers not text.
Businesses and huge webpages use static ip addresses because it can take up to 24 hours for DHCP server to update the changed ip
address to the matching text of website url.


DDNS - dynamic domain name system
Is used at home setups.
DDNS is used only where dynamic ip addresses are used.
When you setup a DDNS (from some DDNS provider...some are free, some are paid), you can connect to your local network when you are 
connecting out from the internet by typing always the same address like myhomepc.ddns.org. This works because the DDNS server
makes user that the address always matches the always changing ip address in DHCP networks. You could of course connect to
your network by ip address itself, but you would have to know each new ip address once the dhcp server assign new address to the 
network.
