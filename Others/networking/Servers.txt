Server.
Server is a dedicated computer that provides services on behalf of clients.
It is a centralised machine (can be both on LAN or out on the WAN) that onther devices can connect to.

There can be dedicated servers each for separate service, like webserver, database server, email server.
Larger organisations will have all critical services separated. Smaller organisations can have multiple services on one server.

Server can be both your computer, which just displays some website or acts as a file server for your local network
or it can be a huge beast that can handle thousands of requests. 

Professional servers need to be running 24/7, therefore their hardware and software needs to be robust. There is a difference between CPUs for
desktops and servers. The CPUs are each optimised for different tasks. Server CPU (like intel Xeon) supports multiprocessing environment, meaning
there can be multiple processors on one motherboard. Xeon processors also support ECC RAM (RAM with error correcting code). Xeon processors also 
support higher RAM, higher cache memory, higher core count. Servers need hot swappable HDD in RAID configuration, to replace asap the faulty HDD in case
it fails. It is a good idea to have extra powersource, in case the main electrical powernet goes down.
