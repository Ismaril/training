Half Duplex
It is a system in communication (wired and wireless) that connects two points and allows communication between them in only one 
direction at a time.
Since there are two ways of transmition there must be a collision detection like CSMA.
Wireless communications are usually half duplex.

Full duplex 
Alllows communication in both ways at the same time. Wired connections are usually full duplex.
