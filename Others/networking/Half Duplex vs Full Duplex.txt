SIMPLEX
It is a system in communication (wired and wireless) that connects two points and allows
communication between them in only one direction.

HALF DUPLEX
It is a system in communication (wired and wireless) that connects two points and allows
communication between them in both directions but only one direction at a time.
Since there are two ways of transmission there must be a collision detection like CSMA.
Wireless communications are usually half duplex. (e.g. visilacka)
Another example: a hub.

Full duplex 
Allows communication in both ways at the same time.
Wired connections are usually full duplex. (But speaking to someone with a telephone is full duplex)
In wired full duplex connections, there is no need for collision detection because there are
separate lanes for both directions.
