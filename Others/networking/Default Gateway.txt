Default gateway
Is a devices that forwards data from one network to another. (for example router/modem)
"Default" means that the designated device is the first option that's looked upon when data needs to exit the network.

An IP address consists of two parts. Network address and host address.
A subnet mask reveals how many bits in the IP address are used for the network by masking the network portion
of the ip address.

IP address 		    binary form
192.168.0.2 	11000000.10101000.00000000.00000010

subnet mask
255.255.255.0	11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
If the subnet mask has one at a certain position, it means that the same position in ip address is used for
network. The positions in subnet mask with zero is used for host. (basically the ip address of local network
will change only in this last part in this example. So all devices under 192.168.0.* network can communicate 
with each other without leaving local network.
