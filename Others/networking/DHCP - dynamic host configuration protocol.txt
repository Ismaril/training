Static IP address
Used in the beginnings of networking, had to be manually set up at PCs settings.
Also you had to remember addresses which you already used in the past for already connected machines, to avoid
	duplicate IP addresses in the same network (would cause IP conflict).


Dynamic IP address
DHCP server automatically assigns
	new ip address,
	subnet mask,
	default gateway,
	DNS server, 
	to each device that connects to a local network.

Range of available can be customised by network admin.
Start IP address 10.0.0.1
End IP address 10.0.0.100
This means there are 100 available addresses.

IP adddress via DHCP is not assigned forever, but for a specified time. This is done not to run out of addresses
when some devices are no longer connected. It frees up the addresses after specified time so that they are
available in case some device disconnected. Devices that are still connected will have the 'lease' durating prolonged.

It is possible to reserve a specific IP address on DHCP server based on your MAC address. It has to be set up 
	manually however.
	There reservation are usualy given to routers, servers, printers or basically anything which is non stop connected.
	

DHCP server (where it runs?)
It can run on external server.
But for home application, it is also usually built in a router, meaning router can assign new ip address and other 
	stuff itself.
