HUBS and SWITCHES
Serve as a exchange points to all the connections on internal network (LAN).
They are not used to exchange data outside local network, for that a router is used.


HUB
The hub is not inteligent because it only copies data.
What comes in to the hub, gets equally copied to all outputs, meaning what comes inside will be outputed on the
	remaining ethernet ports.
Real world situation:
There are connected 4 PCs to the hub. One broadcasts new data into hub. All 3 remaining are connected to the hub.
PC who broadcasts data intends to send the data to only specific one computer, but the remaining pcs will get the 
transmition also. 
	-> This can be both advantage and disadvantage. It really depends on application.
	-> Can be a security risk
	-> Creates unnecessary bandwith


SWITCH
Is inteligent, because it can detect MAC addresses of conected devices and route the traffice directly to the
machine into which it belongs.

Real world situation:
There are 4 PCs connected to the switch. PC1 sends datapacket to the PC2 and the packet arrives only to the PC2, even
though there are two more coputers connected.


ROUTER
Routes data from another external network (based on ip address) to a local network.
Router is a gateway to external network, because it will not let in the data, that are ment for another local network.
