MAIN IDEA BEHIND VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS:
    virtualenvs are meant to only separate dependencies and packages from your projects. (=future
    updates of those packages could have an influence on your projects and might even stop working)
    You shold not include project files in virtualenv, the should just simply be "free to operate with".

ve = virtual envirnoment
you can have venv folder inside your project, but you should not put nothing from your project inside and it
    should be ignored by git

create a new ve:
    name_of_project can actually be just venv
    python3 -m venv name_of_project_env
    python3 -m venv name_of_project_env --system-site-packages (this should inherit or have access to packages in path)

activate ve:
    name_of_project_env\Scripts\activate.bat (on Windows)
    source tutorial-env/bin/activate (on Unix and Mac)

check from where you can execute python:
    where python

check what you got currently installed in ve:
    pip list

intall packages you want:
    pip install desired_module

create a txt file with all modules used in your project (for later installation again somwhere else):
    pip freeze

deactivate environment:
    deactivate

delete ve:
    just delete that directory

install all from requirements into new ve:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
