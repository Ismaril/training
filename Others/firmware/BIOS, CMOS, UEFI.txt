BIOS - Basic Input Output System
BIOS is a firmware that is built into computer's motherboard.
It initializes computers hardware as the computer is being booted. This is called POST (power on self test) which checks that
hardware components are working correctly before a operating system is loaded. If the POST is passed the speakers should make a beep
that the test has been passed. If there are multiple beeps or none, there might be something wrong with the hardware. You can check
the beeb signalization based on manufactures documentation.
Then BIOS searches for optical or storage drive to boot software such as operating system.

The BIOS is stored on the BIOS chip on the motherboard. The BIOS default settings are preserved even when the computer is turned off. If
there is CMOS which has still power, the BIOS can still work with the settings you set in the past. If the CMOS runs out of battery,
BIOS will be reverted to its basic settings.


CMOS 
CMOS is used for storage of BIOS custom settings in CMOS chip. To preserve the data like date/time, boot sequence and hardware settings.
CMOS uses battery for a time when a computer is not connected to power. It is a battery just like in handwatches, and you can 
see it mounted on motherboard. Usually located on the bottom right hand corner.


UEFI - Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
UEFI is a newer version of BIOS with modern graphical interface where you can use also mouse. It comes in all modern motherboards.
UEFI has 'secure boot', that is a build in feature that stops digitally unsigned drivers from loading (prevents loading for ex. malitious software)
