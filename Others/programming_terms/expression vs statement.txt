STATEMENT
In programming, a statement is a unit of code that performs an action, such as assigning a value to a variable, calling a method, or looping over a set of instructions.
Examples of statemtns:
Performs input and/or output
Defines (or forms part of the definition of) a procedure/function/class/variable
Defines a control structure (e.g. if statement, for/while loop)
Although some languages have statements that do nothing (e.g. Python’s pass statement). Some languages make a distinction between definitions and statements, others don’t.

EXPERSION
Expressions return a value. To pick a simple example, x + y is an expresson that returns the result of adding x to y.
In programming, an expression is a combination of variables, constants, and operators that evaluates to a value.
