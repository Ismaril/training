RANDOM INFO:
If you just write a comment, the suggestions might/might not pop up after you start writing actual code sometimes.
You can write comments on multiple lines to let copilot know more what you are trying to do.
Be sure to use grammatically correct language and watch out for your punctuation to get accurate results.
It is possible to seamlessly switch between languages in one project, copilot has no problem with that.
You can iterate with copilot chat on the results he gives you in the chat window. This means if the result needs some little tweaking, you can ask copilot again and he will try to give you a adjustment of previous result.
