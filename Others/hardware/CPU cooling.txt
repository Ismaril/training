CPU (besides GPU) is the hottest part in pc - needs cooling.

Air cooling
IS the most common cooling.
CPU has on itself attached "heat sink". It is aluminium block which has many little plates that go  orthogonally from CPU up. Their
job is to increase surface area of CPU, so that air colling is more efective (more air contact). On top of the heat sing is a fan.
Thermal compount (something like glue or some paste) is applied between CPU and heat sing, to fill the microscopic imperfections
on surface, to improve leading of heat.

Water cooling
Has pump, tube, radiator and fan. - whole unit is placed on top of CPU. The water circulates.
Is more effective at cooling.
More expensive.
Used in high end setups that are making huge computations like gaming pcs etc.
More quiet.
