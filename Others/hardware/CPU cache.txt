As DRAM stores data within capacitors (therefore dynamic, because it has to be constantly recharged), the CPU
memory SRAM (static RAM, because it does not have to be constantly recharged) is faster a lot more expensive.
CPUs memory is also called CACHE.

In cache are stored data that the CPU thinks are going to be used over and over again, therefore need to be
still available for non stop access. This means, that if the data is available in chace, the operation will be
performed very fast, compared if the data has to be loaded from DRAM or even HDD.

Theoretically CPU can run without cache, but it would be a lot slower working with only RAM or even HDD.

There are 3 types of caches.
	level 1 cache - is primary cache and is the fastest one. This one is checked as the first memory in the whole
		computer, when the data are needed.
		Dedicated to only one core.
	level 2 cache - serves as the 2nd in order for data that were not catched by level 1 cache.
		Is also dedicated (together with lvl 1 cache) to one core.
	level 3 cache - last cache in order where CPU checks for data. This cache is common for all cores. If the
		data is not found there, then the CPU has to look into RAM.
