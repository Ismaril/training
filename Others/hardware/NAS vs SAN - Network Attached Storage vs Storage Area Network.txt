NAS & SAN
both of these systems are used for storing data.

NAS - Network Attached Storage
NAS is typically a box, which has many HDD in a RAID setup.
NAS is connected to a switch or router, so the data can be accessed over a netowrk. Now the NAS can be accessed as a shared drive.
Used in homes or small-medium size businesses.
It is not fault tolerant, meaning if somthing happens to NAS, no data from this setup will be available to the network.


SAN - Storage Area Network
SAN is a special and high speed network that provides and stores a large amounts of data. It is dedicated network with main function 
of data storage and data providing.
SAN network contains disk arrays (data storage), switches, optical cables and servers.
SAN is fault tolerant because the same data is shared between several disk arrays.
SAN is recognised as a local attached network compared to shared network drive in NAS.
SAN is highly scalable, you can extend the disk arrays without interupting the function of the SAN.
Used in large size businesses.
