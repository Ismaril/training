Fault tolerance
It is the prevention of data loss if a component fails.


Disaster recovery
Is the process of rebuilding an organisation's data after a disaster.


Data backup types:
1. Full
2. Incremental
3. Differential

Lets take a look at these from perspective of a week days.

1. Full backup
The company makes a full back up of all data each day of the week. This takes a lot of time, when the data is being backed up.
However when the crash happens, the storage device that holds the last full backup can be used to restore the data. It has the 
fastest time of getting all things back to business.

2. Incremental backup
The company makes a full backup of all data on Monday. Then each next day, only data that is backed up are the data of that day.
This means that on Tuesday only Tuesday data are backed up, Wednesday data on Wednesday. So this means that the backups are
made only for the data that chaned each day. Data is also separated into baskets belonging to each day. This is the fastest method
to backup data. However, when you want to restore the data after crash, you not only need to reload the full last backup, but
you have to reload each day's data in the order how they went after each other.

3. Differential backup
The company makes a full backup of all data on Monday. Then it makes a backup of Tuesday. Then it makes the backup of Tuesday+Wednesday.
Then it makes the backup of Tuesday+Wednesday+Thursday. And so on. This takes medium time to backup and also medium time to restore.
In case of data restoration, all you need is the last full backup + the backup of all the days you backed up together.
