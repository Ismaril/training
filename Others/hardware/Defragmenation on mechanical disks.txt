When the data (program, music, ...) is written down on a harddrive, (old spinning one) it is divided into multiple chunks, that
are written down on multiple places at a HDD. As the data are written down, deleted or the disk is getting out of space the data
is written down on locations that could be scattered all around the physical disk. Meaning it takes longer for a head to find all
the data. Defragmentation makes sure, that the divided data accross whole disk is placed together, meaning data lie physically 
close together.

SSD do not require defragmentation because they have no spinning parts and data can be accesed from anywhere without the delay which
would have for example HDD.
