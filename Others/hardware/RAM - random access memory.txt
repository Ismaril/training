RAM

Serves as a temporary storage.
RAM is stored in modules on motherboard called DIMMS (Dual Inline Memory Module)
DIMM means that RAM has two rows of pins (at right and at left side) There can be 168, 184, 240 or 288 pins.
DIMMs will be installed into memory slots on motherboard. There are usually 2-4 memory slots.

In order for program to function, it has to be loaded first from hard drive to RAM and from RAM the CPU can
operate with the data.

The bigger the RAM the better for performance, because the cpu can directly operate with data already avaliable
in RAM. If the RAM is small, all the missing data has to be stored in the meantime on the hard drive and later
loaded to the freed up RAM.

I looked up if the HDD can actually be used as RAM and yes, when the RAM is full, the system can use the portion
of HDD but at the expense of drastical reduction of speed.
