RAID
 - is used to avoid loss of data on disks which store data.
 - data is copied between multiple disks

RAID 0
Data is split between disks, meaning data is not duplicated here.
This setup does not prevent loss of data in case of malfunction of one disk.
Accessing data is faster in this setup.


RAID 1
Data is copied on more than one disk.
In case of loss of one disk, data is save on another disk.


RAID 5
Most common setup.
Requires 3 or more disks.
Data is not duplicated and is 'stripped' along with parity accross the disks. todo: check what this line means
Parity reduces the amount of actual data which could be otherwise stored on the disks.


RAID 10
Combines raid 1 and raid 0.
Requires 4 or more disks.
You can use only 50% of actual data storage.
