RAID
 - is used to avoid loss of data on disks which store data.
 - data is copied between multiple disks

RAID 0
Data is split between disks, meaning data is not duplicated here.
This setup does not prevent loss of data in case of malfunction of one disk.
Accessing data is faster in this setup.


RAID 1
Data is copied on more than one disk.
In case of loss of one disk, data is save on another disk.


RAID 5
Most common setup.
Requires 3 or more disks.
Data is not duplicated and is 'stripped' along with parity accross the disks. Parity is evenly distributed across all disks.
"Parity" reduces the amount of actual data which could be otherwise stored on the disks. If there was no parity
the data would have to be duplicated in that case. With parity you can have for example 3 disks in total, and 2 of them worth
of data will be used for actual data and one for parity (when we take it from scale perspective). In this 3 disk example, 
if one disk fails, the "parity" from other two will be used to rebuild the data one disk that broke. If two disks get broken, 
the data cannot be retrieved back.

RAID 6
Requires 4 or more disks.
The raid 6 is the same as the raid 5, the data is also spread accross disks also parity works the same. However, the parity is
spread 2x in RAID 6. This means that in 4 disk setup two of the disks can get broken at the same time and nothing happens to the
overall collection of former data. Also, since the parity is spread in higher amount, in 4 disk setup 2 disks will be worth of data
and 2 disks will be worth of parity. (from scale perspective)
Readaing from raid6 is the same as from raid5.
Writing to raid 6 is slower due to the writting of double parity.

RAID 10
Combines raid 1 and raid 0.
Requires 4 or more disks.
You can use only 50% of actual data storage.
