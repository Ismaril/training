Broadband cable (coaxial cable)
Coaxial cable has copper core.
Broadband cable typically transmits both TV and internet in the same cable from the provider.
Speed from 25Mb/s to 400Mb/s
To transform the signal from the cable, modem (often modem, router, switch in one) is needed.
There is a bottle neck, because you might share the same pool of bandwith over a common cable provided by an telecomunication provider
in your local area. This means that in hours of high usage, the performance can decrease to all connected.


DSL - digital subscriver line
Uses copper line.
Is used to both transer telephone signal and internet.
DSL modem needed (meaning instead of coaxial cable you would insert into modem telephone line).
(Actually by DSL is not meant old DSL, the slow dial up system, fyi...)
When you are connected via DSL, you do not have the same line with others meaning the bandwith is not necessarily affected by others.
Zou just have your own dedicated line.
DSL is cheaper compared to broadband cable.
More widely available than broadband cable.
Speed from 5Mb/s to 100Mb/s

ADSL - asymetric digital subscriver line
Download speed is considerably faster than upload.
Widely used at homes.

SDSL - symetric digital subscriver line
download and upload speeds are the same
Typically used in businesses.

VDSL - very high bit rate digital subscriver line
Very fast form of DSL.
It is used for shorter distances, because optic cables are better at longer distances.
3x faster than ADSL


Optic cables
Download and upload 1Gb/s.
Uses glass as a wire to transmit pulses of light across very long distances.
Has advantage over copper cables because the can be affected by electromagnetical interference.
Disadvantage is the price and also it is not as widely available yet as previous options.
