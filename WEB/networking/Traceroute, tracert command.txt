Traceroute
Traceroute is a cmd utility that allows us to see the route which datapackets travel untill they reach final destination.
It is a handy tool to find for example bottlenecks in a route.
Traceroute not only pings the final destination but also each router along the way.

Composition of returned values for each router along the way, consecutively.
Number of hops, 3 data packets, ip address


TTL - time to live (number of hops)
This is a limit for hops to reach a final destination. If the number is exceeded the trace will be completed.
