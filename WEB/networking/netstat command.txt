Netstat - network statistics
It is a cmd tool used to display the current network connections and port ativity on your computer.

protocol localaddress:portnumber foreignaddress:portname/portnumber
TCP    192.168.1.127:50822    20.90.153.243:https    ESTABLISHED

"netstat -n"
Show only numbers instead of names in the netstat returned connections.
This can save up time, because you will get only numbers not any names that have to be returned by DNS server.

"netstat -a"
Shows witch TCP and UDP ports are listening for connection.
If you see 0.0.0.0:some_port_number that means that port is not listening on a specific ipv4 address but on all available ip addresses.
The same is if you see [::]:some_port_number but it is ipv6.

"netstat -b"
CHeck wich program is being used to make a connection.
You will se for example [chrome.exe] etc.

"netstat -f"
Shows full qualified domain name in the foreign address column.


You can also combine the switches, like "netstat -an" or "netstat -bf" etc.
