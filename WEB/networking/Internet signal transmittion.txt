My take on how it works.

Todo: this might require multiple iterations to write everything down.

Data is stored in a local network on a disk, could be a server or just a pc. Request todo: fill this. Data from datacentres travel usually
by optical cables. Optical cables are main tracks of internet data transmition. It is possible that the data gets from the source to your pc
just by a optical cable, but the infrastructure has to be implemented at your side. Otherwise the data is delivered to todo:check where. From 
this place the data can be transfered to your location by TV cable (coaxial cable) telephone cable (RJ11/RJ12) or wirelessly. Wireless
traffic can be distributed by 'fixed wireless' points. These points are in sight to each other and can transmit data to locations
where is not cable infrastructure. The wireless signal is transmited as radio wave meaning analog signal.
