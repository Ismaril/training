Bluetooth
Is a low power, wireless technology that uses short range radio that provides a way to connect nearby devices to each other.
Bluetooth devices have a chip that transmits signal so that other devices can catch it and connect (pairing).
Range 10 meters.
Has a slower transfer rate and shorter range than WIFI, but this is a benefit that it does not drain as much of devices batery.
Operates at 2.4Ghz.
The bluetooth is less vulnerable to interference because it uses FHSS (frequency hopping spread spectrum). This system uses transmition of data in a pattern
that only bluetooth devices can understand - the signal hops between 79 different channels and changes channels 1600 per second.


WIFI
Is a wireless technology that uses radio waves that allow devices to be able to connect to the internet.
Devices connected via WIFI connect to a router/modem that then connects to a internet service provider. The devices connected to the WIFI can be
also configured that the create a local network.
Range 30-91 meters.
Has faster transfer rate and longer range than Bluetooth, but it requires more energy to be operational.
Operates at 2.4Ghz.
Is more vulnerable to interference if using 2.4Ghz.
