Explained in my words:
Port forwarding in your local area network (LAN) is used when you want to allow access to outside clients into
your netowrk. By default all incoming traffics are blocked into your network. When you want the outside clients
to initiate the connection into your local netowrk, you have to manualy specify it in your router. There are
predefined port numbers, which are each used for different purposes. For example 80 for HTTP, 20 and 21 for FTP,
443 for HTTPS etc. When you open a page and want to get back the info from your request, it will return back
to your network because it was you who initiated the connection in the first place.

Port forwarding allows computers to connect into private network. It basically means that you can make your computer 
accessible to outside even though you are behind a router.

Port number is ALWAYS sent together with IP address like 192.168.1.127:139 (:139) meaning the request is 
regarding service which is represented by number 139. IP address has the main purpouse to find the destinaiton,
but the port has the main purpouse to identify the service or the purpouse of request.

If you want to allow remote connection into your LAN, you have to specify the number of port number and
static IP address of the device in your network, into which the connection should be established. For example, if
you want just remote control from outter computer use some higher number like 3380 (not to conflict the reserved ports)

The range of all possible ports ir from 0 - 65535.
The privileged category is from 0 - 1023, meaning in this range are the most common services used in general by 
everyone.
