RJ45
Most common type of connector.
Has 8 pins.
Used to connect devices in LAN.
Used with UTP (unshielded twisted pair calbe)

UTP coupler
Used to connect RJ45 connectors - connect two cables together, meaning this UTP coupler is a female.


RJ48
Looks similar to RJ45
Used with STP (shielded twisted pair calbe)
Is wired differently compared to RJ45
Primarily used with T1 lines. todo: check what is T1


RJ11
4 wire connector 
Used to connect telephone equipment.
Also used for networking together with modem.
Little bit smaller than RJ45


BNC connector
Used with coaxial cables.
USed to transfer digital and analog data.
BNC T connector - connects 3 coaxial cables together.
BNC coupler - connects 2 coaxial cables together.
BNC terminator - used to terminate the ends of the cable.

F-type
Used with coaxial cables.
Used by cable providers to attach to cable modems.
Has a nut that has to be screwed to connect to a desired place.
Used with satelite internet.


USB - universal serial bus


SC - standart connector (Fibre optics)
First of connectors used in fibre optics

MTRJ - mechanical transfer register jack (Fibre optics)
Connector that uses a latched pull-pull connection
Designed to replace the SC connector.
Uses 2 fibres in a single design.
Resembles RJ45
Becoming increasingly popular in fibre optics today.

LC - local connector (Fibre optics)
Designed to compete with SC connector
Has hlaf the size compared to SC connector.
Uses a latch similar to RJ45

ST - straight tip (Fibre optics)
Is on decilne with usage.


Fibre coupler (Fibre optics)
Used to connect two cables with the same connector.


UPC vs APC
Technologies that are regarding data refraction at the end of cables. APC uses cables that are cut with some degree (not perpendicular as UPC),
meaning when the light refracts it refracts into the cable wall and it does not cause that much of signal loss.
