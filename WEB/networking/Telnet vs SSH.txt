Telnet and SSH (Secure Shell) are both network protocols used to access and manage devices remotely,
but they differ significantly in terms of security features and common use cases.
Here's a detailed comparison of the two protocols:

Telnet
Telnet (Telecommunication Network) is one of the oldest remote login protocols that operates on the
application layer of the OSI model.
It was developed in the late 1960s to allow users to connect to remote computers over a network.
Here are the key aspects of Telnet:
 - Security: Telnet does not encrypt data, which means that all communications,
 including potentially sensitive information such as usernames and passwords,
 are transmitted in clear text. This makes it vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping.
 - Usage: Due to its simplicity, Telnet was widely used for remote administration of devices,
 especially in early network environments. However, because of its security vulnerabilities,
 its use in secure environments is now generally discouraged.
- Port: Telnet typically uses TCP port 23.

SSH
SSH (Secure Shell) was developed in the mid-1990s as a secure replacement for Telnet and other
insecure remote shell protocols. SSH provides a secure channel over an unsecured network,
offering significant security enhancements:
 - Encryption: SSH uses strong encryption to ensure that all data transmitted over the network
 is secure. This includes login credentials and the data being transmitted.
 - Authentication: SSH supports more robust authentication methods,
 including the use of public key cryptography. This allows for both the server and the user to
 verify each other's identity.
 - Integrity: SSH ensures the integrity of the data using secure hashing algorithms,
 making it immune to tampering during transmission.
 - Usage: SSH is used for securely logging into systems, executing commands remotely,
 transferring files using associated protocols (SCP, SFTP),
 and managing network infrastructure and other critical system components.
Port: SSH typically uses TCP port 22.

Comparison of Telnet vs SSH
Security:
The most significant difference is security.
SSH was explicitly designed to address the security weaknesses of Telnet.
The encryption and integrity features of SSH make it suitable for use over insecure networks like
the internet.

Performance:
SSH might introduce a slight overhead due to its encryption mechanisms,
but this is generally negligible given modern computational power.

Functionality:
Both protocols provide similar basic functionalities for remote command execution,
but SSH offers additional features such as port forwarding, tunneling,
and file transfers, which are not natively supported by Telnet.

Applicability:
 While Telnet can still be used in controlled or legacy environments where security is not a
 concern, SSH is recommended for all other uses, especially when security and data privacy are
 critical.

In conclusion, while Telnet and SSH serve the same fundamental purpose of remote system access,
SSH is overwhelmingly preferred in almost all scenarios due to its robust security features.
The use of Telnet is now largely restricted to specific legacy systems and environments where
security is not an issue.

Telnet - teletype network
Developed in 1969
Telnet is a simple command line tool, that allows you to send commands to a server and administer it. It can be done both in LAN and also in WAN.
With telnet you can run programs, create folders,  delete files, create files, transfer files, browse directories, start/stop services, ...
With telnet it is also possible to administer other network devices like routers and switches.
Can be also used to test ports on a server.
Since telnet is only command line and it sends only text, it is very fast.
It's downside is however security because it does not encrypt data.
It is sometimes used fo communication with old devices or on local area network.


SSH - secure shell
It does the same thing as telnet but securely - SSH is a cryptographic network protocol
for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.
Secureshell encrypts the data.
Provides password and public key authenitication.
It is used today instead of telnet.
