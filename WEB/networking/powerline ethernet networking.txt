Powerline ethernet networking

This is a system in which data are transfered through a electrical net.

Take an example a factory building. There might be a part of the complex that does not for some reasone allow instalation of
new ethernet cables of wifi routers. There is a possibility to send data through electrical net. You just need adapters 
with RJ45 connector hole which you plug into the wall. Also there will be need for modem in order to translate data.

There is no need for software or hardware configuration. You just plug the adapter in the electricity.

This system is similar just as if you were sending data through telephone line (which supports both phone communication and
data transfer). It is possible due to transmittion of data on different frequencies.
