MODEM = ModulerDemodulator
Used for communication with outer net via analog signal.
Between your PC and MODEM is digital (0 and 1) communication and between the model and outter world is analog
signal (wave).
When the analog signal comes from the outer net, it has to demodulated into digital signal and it has to do the
reverse (modulate) when you want to send the data out.
Modems are connected via coaxial cable (cable for TV) or DSL modems are connected via phone line (RJ11/RJ12)  

ROUTER
Router comes after the modem in the direction towards your local machines. It is used to distribute the digital
signal in your local net. It can distribute it wirelessly or via cable or both.
Router can be also a switch, that means it could distribute wirelessly or through LAN cable from its ports. (usually
there are 4 ports in the router). If you need to connect only one device in your local net, technically you do
not need a router and you can connect directly to the modem.
There might be router models that have modem and router in one device.
