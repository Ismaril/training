TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

TCP makes sure that the	communication is reliable and data is fetched correctly, completely and without errors.
(Webpage loading correctly, the file is downloaded complete meaning nothing is missing,... etc)

TCP is connection oriented protocol, meaning the TCP has to first check that the two computers are communicating,
	meaning the session has started. (3 steps as described below)
	- Sender PC sends a SYN message.
	- Reciver PC must return SYN acknowledgment back to sender
	- Sender PC sends acknowledgment to reciver PC that acknoledgment arrived.

TCP guarantees the delivery of data, meaning if some data is missing in the reciever PC, TCP makes sure that
	the sender PC resends it.


UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
UDP is connectionless oriented protocol, meaning it does not establish a session between two computers and does not
	quarantee delivery of data.
	If the sender PC sends the data, it is not guaranteed that the data will be recieved at the reciever PC.
The only advantage of UDP is that is faster than TCP.
