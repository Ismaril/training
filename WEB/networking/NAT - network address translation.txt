NAT - network address translation

Is a service that is used in routers, due to the IPv4.
Its main purpouse is to convert IP address which is publicly registered (address of your router for ex.) to a local
address. Also when local device wants to send something out to the internet it's address (such as 192.168.x.x) will
be converted by router to public IP address which was assigned to your router by your internet provider. 
This means that router has one public address which is visible to the outside world and one local address
whic is the same subnet as the connected devices in your local network. Main purpouse of NAT is not to run out of
public ipv4 addresses.

In the future of IPv6 there will be no need for NAT.
