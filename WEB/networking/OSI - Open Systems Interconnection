The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and
standardize the functions of a telecommunications or computing system without regard to its
underlying internal structure and technology.
Developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1984,
the OSI model provides a universal set of rules and guidelines that different network devices,
protocols, and software can follow to communicate effectively, regardless of their underlying architecture.

The OSI model is structured into seven distinct layers, each serving a specific function and
interacting with the layers directly above and below it. From the bottom (layer 1) to the top (layer 7),
these layers are:

Physical Layer:
Concerned with the transmission and reception of the unstructured raw bitstream over a physical medium.
Deals with aspects such as electrical and physical connections, voltage levels, data rates, and distance limitations.
Examples: Ethernet cables (Cat5, Cat6), Fiber Optics, USB, HDMI.


Data Link Layer:
Responsible for node-to-node data transfer and error detection and correction.
Defines the protocol for the MAC (Media Access Control) address and LLC (Logical Link Control).
Examples: Ethernet, Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11), PPP.


Network Layer:
Manages the delivery of packets between two different hosts across multiple networks.
Handles packet routing, forwarding, and addressing (logical/IP addressing).
Examples: IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP.


Transport Layer:
Ensures the reliable transmission of data segments between points on a network, including error correction,
segmentation, and flow control.
Examples: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).


Session Layer:
Manages sessions, establishing, maintaining, and terminating connections between applications.
Examples: NFS (Network File System), RPC (Remote Procedure Call), NetBIOS.


Presentation Layer:
Translates data between the application layer and the network format, ensuring interoperability between encoding methods.
Manages data encryption, decryption, compression, and decompression.
Examples: SSL/TLS, JPEG, MPEG.


Application Layer:
Closest to the end-user and serves as the interface for users and applications to access network services.
Manages application-level functions like email, file transfers, and web browsing.
Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS.


The OSI model's primary purpose is educational and theoretical,
offering a standard for network protocol design and understanding network functionality.
While many protocols and systems do not strictly adhere to the OSI model's layered approach
(with the Internet protocol suite/TCP/IP model being a prominent example),
the OSI model remains an essential reference for teaching and understanding network architecture principles.
