Firewall
Firewall is a system that is designed to prevent unauthorised access from entering a private network.
It gives access to wanted traffic and blocks unwanted traffic.
Firewall can be of two types. One type is that the firewall is a filter between outer internet and local network. (network based firewall)
The other is a filter before a device, for example computer (called host based firewall, installed directly on computer).
Firewall comes actually from real world - fire wall is an actual wall in a building that prevents spreading fire in a building.
Firewall works by allowing or denying access by "access control list". The list can look like this:

Permision, IP address, Protocol, Destination, Port
Allow, 54.21.66.112, TCP, ANY, 80
Deny, 10.10.0.1, UDP, ANY, 3368
Allow, ANY, TCP, ANY, 110


Firewall can be directly build in in routers.
It can also be as a standalone hardware, which is used as a network based firewall.
(used by large organisations). Firewall can also be cloud based.

When it comes to firewall in a router, it comes preconfigured, therefore average user
does not have to set up anything. But of course if you want to add extra rules, you can do it.
The same applies for PC firewall. It comes preconfigured, but if you want you can add extra rules
or additonal software that will help you to protect your computer.
