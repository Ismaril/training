FTP - file transfer protocol
FTP is a system that computers use to transfer file over TCP/IP.
If you want to make your files available to the internet you can either upload them to FTP server, or you can setup your PC as FTP server.
To access FTP server you can use both web browser or ftp client (GUI).
So if you want to access remote ftp server, open web browser and type in ftp.name_of_that_site.com. So you can see that there is
a difference to regular website that would start the address with https://www.name_of_that_site.com. Once you are in the FTP server
via your browser it will look inside like when you are browsing your local disk via browser. Some FTP servers will require an account
with password but some will let you get in anonymously.

In case you wanted to connect to FTP server via GUI you can use for example Filezilla. Uou then insert your login, passwrod,
server where you want to connect (host) and port (21, 22...I think)

FTP is however not really used byt normal people.
It is handy when web designers or admins want to transfer files to their web servers.

FTP is not secure - all the data IS NOT encrypted. You should therefore only transfer data that is not sensitive.



SFTP - secure file transfer protocol
It is the same as FTP, except SFTP is encrypted using secure shell. SFTP autenticates both the user and the server before communication.
SFTP uses port 22.
Also communicates over TCP/IP.



TFTP - trivial file transfer protocol
Is used only on local network not for world wide web.
Is not used by regular humans, rather is used by network devices to transfer, for example, config files.
Used UPD instead of TCP (data delivery is not guaranteed)
TFTP does not encrypt data.
