This "syntax_NET_core" solution, judging by the name, does not necessarily mean
that it explains all the new syntax of the .NET Core framework. While it is true,
that I was trying to show the syntax of the .NET Core framework, I was named
like this to distinguish it from the "syntax" solution, which is a solution
made in the old .NET Framework.
