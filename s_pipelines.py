"""
A pipeline is whatever is processed in steps, even in real life:
You wake up
You have a shower
Yo go to work
You repeat that everyday, in that order.

You can have pipelines also in code:
You receive an string
You trim whitespaces
You capitalize each word
You return the transformed string

You can have pipelines also in a single app:
You receive a request
You read from db
You return a response

You can have also pipelines in infrastructure:
Something pull data from an api
This data is stored in a db
Notifications are sent by email saying "done"
